  <h2 class='c006'>TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It must be left to critics to say whether it was Destiny or Incident—using
these words in the author’s sense—that Spengler’s <span lang="de">“Untergang des Abendlandes”</span>
appeared in July, 1918, that is, at the very turning-point of the four
years’ World-War. It was conceived, the author tells us, before 1914 and fully
worked out by 1917. So far as he is concerned, then, the impulse to create it
arose from a view of our civilization not as the late war left it, but (as he says
expressly) as the <em>coming</em> war would find it. But inevitably the public impulse
to read it arose in and from post-war conditions, and thus it happened that this
severe and difficult philosophy of history found a market that has justified the
printing of 90,000 copies. Its very title was so apposite to the moment as to
predispose the higher intellectuals to regard it as a work of the moment—the
more so as the author was a simple Oberlehrer and unknown to the world of
authoritative learning.</p>

<p class='c001'>Spengler’s was not the only, nor indeed the most “popular,” philosophical
product of the German revolution. In the graver conjunctures, sound minds do
not dally with the graver questions—they either face and attack them with
supernormal resolution or thrust them out of sight with an equally supernormal
effort to enjoy or to endure the day as it comes. Even after the return to normality,
it is no longer possible for men—at any rate for Western men—not to
know that these questions exist. And, if it is none too easy even for the victors
of the struggle to shake off its sequelæ, to turn back to business as the normal
and to give no more than amateur effort and dilettantish attention to the very
deep things, for the defeated side this is impossible. It goes through a period of
material difficulty (often extreme difficulty) and one in which pride of achievement
and humility in the presence of unsuccess work dynamically together. So
it was with sound minds in the post-Jena Germany of Jahn and Fichte, and so it
was also with such minds in the Germany of 1919-1920.</p>

<p class='c001'>To assume the rôle of critic and to compare Spengler’s with other philosophies
of the present phase of Germany, as to respective intrinsic weights, is not
the purpose of this note nor within the competence of its writer. On the other
hand, it is unconditionally necessary for the reader to realize that the book before
him has not only acquired this large following amongst thoughtful laymen, but
has forced the attention and taxed the scholarship of every branch of the learned
world. Theologians, historians, scientists, art critics—all saw the challenge,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>and each brought his <span lang="la"><i>apparatus criticus</i></span> to bear on that part of the Spengler
theory that affected his own domain. The reader who is familiar with German
may be referred to Manfred Schroeter’s <span lang="de">“Der Streit um Spengler”</span> for details;
it will suffice here to say that Schroeter’s index of critics’ names contains some
400 entries. These critics are not only, or even principally, general reviewers,
most of them being specialists of high standing. It is, to say the least, remarkable
that a volcanically assertive philosophy of history, visibly popular and
produced under a catchy title (Reklamtitel) should call forth, as it did, a special
number of <em>Logos</em> in which the Olympians of scholarship passed judgment on
every inaccuracy or unsupported statement that they could detect. (These were
in fact numerous in the first edition and the author has corrected or modified
them in detail in the new edition, from which this translation has been done.
But it should be emphasized that the author has not, in this second edition,
receded in any essentials from the standpoint taken up in the first.)</p>

<p class='c001'>The conspicuous features in this first burst of criticism were, on the one hand,
want of adequate critical equipment in the general critic, and, on the other, inability
to see the wood for the trees in the man of learning. No one, reading
Schroeter’s book (which by the way is one-third as large as Spengler’s first
volume itself), can fail to agree with his judgment that notwithstanding
paradoxes, overstrainings, and inaccuracies, the work towers above all its commentators.
And it was doubtless a sense of this greatness that led many scholars—amongst
them some of the very high—to avoid expressing opinions on it
at all. It would be foolish to call their silence a “sitting on the fence”; it is a
case rather of reserving judgment on a philosophy and a methodology that
challenge all the canons and carry with them immense implications. For the
very few who combine all the necessary depth of learning with all the necessary
freedom and breadth of outlook, it will not be the accuracy or inaccuracy of
details under a close magnifying-glass that will be decisive. The very idea of
accuracy and inaccuracy presupposes the selection or acceptance of co-ordinates
of reference, and therefore the selection or acceptance of a standpoint as “origin.”
That is mere elementary science—and yet the scholar-critic would be
the first to claim the merit of scientific rigour for his criticisms! It is, in history
as in science, impossible to draw a curve through a mass of plotted observations
when they are looked at closely and almost individually.</p>

<p class='c001'>Criticism of quite another and a higher order may be seen in Dr. Eduard
Meyer’s article on Spengler in the <span lang="de"><cite>Deutsche Literaturzeitung</cite></span>, No. 25 of 1924. Here
we find, in one of the great figures of modern scholarship, exactly that large-minded
judgment that, while noting minor errors—and visibly attaching
little importance to them—deals with the Spengler thesis fairly and squarely
on the grand issues alone. Dr. Meyer differs from Spengler on many serious
questions, of which perhaps the most important is that of the scope and origin
of the Magian Culture. But instead of cataloguing the errors that are still to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>found in Spengler’s vast ordered multitude of facts, Eduard Meyer honourably
bears testimony to our author’s <span lang="de">“erstaunlich umfangreiches, <em>ihm ständig
präsentes, Wissen</em>”</span> (a phrase as neat and as untranslatable as Goethe’s <span lang="de">“exakte
sinnliche Phantasie”</span>). He insists upon the fruitfulness of certain of Spengler’s
ideas such as that of the “Second Religiousness.” Above all, he adheres to and
covers with his high authority the basic idea of the parallelism of organically-living
Cultures. It is not necessarily Spengler’s structure of the Cultures that he
accepts—parts of it indeed he definitely rejects as wrong or insufficiently established
by evidences—but on the question of their being <em>an</em> organic structure
of the Cultures, <em>a</em> morphology of History, he ranges himself frankly by the side
of the younger thinker, whose work he sums up as a <span lang="de">“bleibendez und auf lange
Zeit hinaus nachhaltig wirkendes Besitz unserer Wissenschaft und Literatur.”</span>
This last phrase of Dr. Meyer’s expresses very directly and simply that which
for an all-round student (as distinct from an erudite specialist) constitutes the
peculiar <em>quality</em> of Spengler’s work. Its influence is far deeper and subtler than
any to which the conventional adjective “suggestive” could be applied. It
cannot in fact be described by adjectives at all, but only denoted or adumbrated
by its result, which is that, after studying and mastering it, “one finds it nearly
if not quite impossible to approach any culture-problem—old or new, dogmatic
or artistic, political or scientific—without conceiving it primarily as
‘morphological.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>The work comprises two volumes—under the respective sub-titles “Form
and Reality” and “World-historical Perspectives”—of which the present
translation covers the first only. Some day I hope to have the opportunity of
completing a task which becomes—such is the nature of this book—more
attractive in proportion to its difficulty. References to Volume II are, for the
present, necessarily to the pages of the German original; if, as is hoped, this
translation is completed later by the issue of the second volume, a list of the
necessary adjustments of page references will be issued with it. The reader will
notice that translator’s foot-notes are scattered fairly freely over the pages of
this edition. In most cases these have no pretensions to being critical annotations.
They are merely meant to help the reader to follow up in more detail the
points of fact which Spengler, with his <span lang="de">“ständig präsentes Wissen,”</span> sweeps
along in his course. This being their object, they take the form, in the majority
of cases, of references to appropriate articles in the Encyclopædia Britannica,
which is the only single work that both contains reasonably full information
on the varied (and often abstruse) matters alluded to, and is likely to be accessible
wherever this book may penetrate. Every reader no doubt will find these
notes, where they appertain to his own special subject, trivial and even annoying,
but it is thought that, for example, an explanation of the mathematical
Limit may be helpful to a student who knows all about the Katharsis in Greek
drama, and <span lang="la"><i>vice versa</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>In conclusion I cannot omit to put on record the part that my wife, Hannah
Waller Atkinson, has taken in the work of translation and editing. I may best
describe it by saying that it ought perhaps to have been recorded on the title
page instead of in this place.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>At the close of an undertaking which, from the first brief sketch to the final
shaping of a complete work of quite unforeseen dimensions, has spread itself
over ten years, it will not be out of place to glance back at what I intended and
what I have achieved, my standpoint then and my standpoint to-day.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the Introduction to the 1918 edition—inwardly and outwardly a fragment—I
stated my conviction that an idea had now been irrefutably formulated
which no one would oppose, once the idea had been put into words. I
ought to have said: once that idea had been understood. And for that we must
look—as I more and more realize—not only in this instance but in the whole
history of thought—to the new generation that is <em>born</em> with the ability to
do it.</p>

<p class='c001'>I added that this must be considered as a first attempt, loaded with all the
customary faults, incomplete and not without inward opposition. The remark
was not taken anything like as seriously as it was intended. Those who have
looked searchingly into the hypotheses of living thought will know that it is
not given to us to gain insight into the fundamental principles of existence
without conflicting emotions. A thinker is a person whose part it is to symbolize
time according to his vision and understanding. He has no choice; he
thinks as he has to think. Truth in the long run is to him the picture of the
world which was born at his birth. It is that which he does not invent but
rather discovers within himself. It is himself over again: his being expressed
in words; the meaning of his personality formed into a doctrine which so far
as concerns his life is unalterable, because truth and his life are identical. This
symbolism is the one essential, the vessel and the expression of human history.
The learned philosophical works that arise out of it are superfluous and only
serve to swell the bulk of a professional literature.</p>

<p class='c001'>I can then call the essence of what I have discovered “true”—that is, <em>true
for me</em>, and as I believe, true for the leading minds of the coming time; not true
in itself as dissociated from the conditions imposed by blood and by history, for
that is impossible. But what I wrote in the storm and stress of those years was,
it must be admitted, a very imperfect statement of what stood clearly before
me, and it remained to devote the years that followed to the task of correlating
facts and finding means of expression which should enable me to present my
idea in the most forcible form.</p>

<p class='c001'>To perfect that form would be impossible—life itself is only fulfilled in
death. But I have once more made the attempt to bring up even the earliest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>portions of the work to the level of definiteness with which I now feel able to
speak; and with that I take leave of this book with its hopes and disappointments,
its merits and its faults.</p>

<p class='c001'>The result has in the meantime justified itself as far as I myself am concerned
and—judging by the effect that it is slowly beginning to exercise upon extensive
fields of learning—as far as others are concerned also. Let no one expect
to find everything set forth here. It is <em>but one side</em> of what I see before me,
a new outlook on <em>history and the philosophy of destiny</em>—the first indeed of its
kind. It is intuitive and depictive through and through, written in a language
which seeks to present objects and relations illustratively instead of offering
an army of ranked concepts. It addresses itself solely to readers who are capable
of living themselves into the word-sounds and pictures as they read. Difficult
this undoubtedly is, particularly as our awe in face of mystery—the respect
that Goethe felt—denies us the satisfaction of thinking that dissections are
the same as penetrations.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of course, the cry of “pessimism” was raised at once by those who live
eternally in yesterday (<span lang="de"><i>Ewiggestrigen</i></span>) and greet every idea that is intended for
the pathfinder of to-morrow only. But I have not written for people who
imagine that delving for the springs of action is the same as action itself; those
who make definitions do not know destiny.</p>

<p class='c001'>By understanding the world I mean being equal to the world. It is the hard
reality of living that is the essential, not the concept of life, that the ostrich-philosophy
of idealism propounds. Those who refuse to be bluffed by enunciations
will not regard this as pessimism; and the rest do not matter. For the
benefit of serious readers who are seeking a glimpse at life and not a definition,
I have—in view of the far too great concentration of the text—mentioned
in my notes a number of works which will carry that glance into more distant
realms of knowledge.</p>

<p class='c001'>And now, finally, I feel urged to name once more those to whom I owe
practically everything: Goethe and Nietzsche. Goethe gave me method,
Nietzsche the questioning faculty—and if I were asked to find a formula for
my relation to the latter I should say that I had made of his “outlook” (<span lang="de"><i>Ausblick</i></span>)
an “overlook” (<span lang="de"><i>Überblick</i></span>). But Goethe was, without knowing it, a
disciple of Leibniz in his whole mode of thought. And, therefore, that which
has at last (and to my own astonishment) taken shape in my hands I am able
to regard and, despite the misery and disgust of these years, proud to call <em>a
German philosophy</em>.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The complete manuscript of this book—the outcome of three years’ work—was
ready when the Great War broke out. By the spring of 1917 it had
been worked over again and—in certain details—supplemented and cleared
up, but its appearance in print was still delayed by the conditions then prevailing.</p>

<p class='c001'>Although a philosophy of history is its scope and subject, it possesses also a
certain deeper significance as a commentary on the great epochal moment of
which the portents were visible when the leading ideas were being formed.</p>

<p class='c001'>The title, which had been decided upon in 1912, expresses quite literally the
intention of the book, which was to describe, in the light of the decline of the
Classical age, one world-historical phase of several centuries upon which we
ourselves are now entering.</p>

<p class='c001'>Events have justified much and refuted nothing. It became clear that these
ideas must necessarily be brought forward at just this moment and in Germany,
and, more, that the war itself was an element in the premisses from which the
new world-picture could be made precise.</p>

<p class='c001'>For I am convinced that it is not merely a question of writing one out of
several possible and merely logically justifiable philosophies, but of writing <em>the</em>
philosophy of our time, one that is to some extent a natural philosophy and is
dimly presaged by all. This may be said without presumption; for an idea that
is historically essential—that does not occur within an epoch but itself makes
that epoch—is only in a limited sense the property of him to whose lot it
falls to parent it. It belongs to our time as a whole and influences all thinkers,
without their knowing it; it is but the accidental, private attitude towards it
(without which no philosophy can exist) that—with its faults and its merits—is
the destiny and the happiness of the individual.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER I<br> <br> INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c016'>I</h3>

<p class='c017'>In this book is attempted for the first time the venture of predetermining history,
of following the still untravelled stages in the destiny of a Culture, and
specifically of the only Culture of our time and on our planet which is actually
in the phase of fulfilment—the West-European-American.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hitherto the possibility of solving a problem so far-reaching has evidently
never been envisaged, and even if it had been so, the means of dealing with it
were either altogether unsuspected or, at best, inadequately used.</p>

<p class='c001'>Is there a logic of history? Is there, beyond all the casual and incalculable
elements of the separate events, something that we may call a metaphysical
structure of historic humanity, something that is essentially independent of
the outward forms—social, spiritual and political—which we see so clearly?
Are not these actualities indeed secondary or derived from that something?
Does world-history present to the seeing eye certain grand traits, again and
again, with sufficient constancy to justify certain conclusions? And if so, what
are the limits to which reasoning from such premisses may be pushed?</p>

<p class='c001'>Is it possible to find in life itself—for human history is the sum of mighty
life-courses which already have had to be endowed with ego and personality,
in customary thought and expression, by predicating entities of a higher order
like “the Classical” or “the Chinese Culture,” “Modern Civilization”—a
series of stages which must be traversed, and traversed moreover in an ordered
and obligatory sequence? For everything organic the notions of birth, death,
youth, age, lifetime are fundamentals—may not these notions, in this sphere
also, possess a rigorous meaning which no one has as yet extracted? In short,
is all history founded upon general biographic archetypes?</p>

<p class='c001'>The decline of the West, which at first sight may appear, like the corresponding
decline of the Classical Culture, a phenomenon limited in time and
space, we now perceive to be a philosophical problem that, when comprehended
in all its gravity, includes within itself every great question of
Being.</p>

<p class='c001'>If therefore we are to discover in what form the destiny of the Western
Culture will be accomplished, we must first be clear as to what culture <em>is</em>, what
its relations are to visible history, to life, to soul, to nature, to intellect, what
the forms of its manifestation are and how far these forms—peoples, tongues
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>and epochs, battles and ideas, states and gods, arts and craft-works, sciences,
laws, economic types and world-ideas, great men and great events—may be
accepted and pointed to as symbols.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>II</h3>

<p class='c018'>The means whereby to identify dead forms is Mathematical Law. The
means whereby to understand living forms is Analogy. By these means we
are enabled to distinguish polarity and periodicity in the world.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is, and has always been, a matter of knowledge that the expression-forms
of world-history are limited in number, and that eras, epochs, situations,
persons are ever repeating themselves true to type. Napoleon has hardly ever
been discussed without a side-glance at Cæsar and Alexander—analogies of
which, as we shall see, the first is morphologically quite inacceptable and the
second is correct—while Napoleon himself conceived of his situation as akin
to Charlemagne’s. The French Revolutionary Convention spoke of Carthage
when it meant England, and the Jacobins styled themselves Romans. Other
such comparisons, of all degrees of soundness and unsoundness, are those of
Florence with Athens, Buddha with Christ, primitive Christianity with
modern Socialism, the Roman financial magnate of Cæsar’s time with the
Yankee. Petrarch, the first passionate archæologist (and is not archæology itself
an expression of the sense that history is repetition?) related himself mentally
to Cicero, and but lately Cecil Rhodes, the organizer of British South
Africa, who had in his library specially prepared translations of the classical
lives of the Cæsars, felt himself akin to the Emperor Hadrian. The fated
Charles XII of Sweden used to carry Quintus Curtius’s life of Alexander in his
pocket, and to copy that conqueror was his deliberate purpose.</p>

<p class='c001'>Frederick the Great, in his political writings—such as his <span lang="fr"><cite>Considérations</cite></span>,
1738—moves among analogies with perfect assurance. Thus he compares
the French to the Macedonians under Philip and the Germans to the Greeks.
“Even now,” he says, “the Thermopylæ of Germany, Alsace and Lorraine,
are in the hands of Philip,” therein exactly characterizing the policy of Cardinal
Fleury. We find him drawing parallels also between the policies of the
Houses of Habsburg and Bourbon and the proscriptions of Antony and of
Octavius.</p>

<p class='c001'>Still, all this was only fragmentary and arbitrary, and usually implied rather
a momentary inclination to poetical or ingenious expressions than a really deep
sense of historical forms.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus in the case of Ranke, a master of artistic analogy, we find that his
parallels of Cyaxares and Henry the Fowler, of the inroads of the Cimmerians
and those of the Hungarians, possess morphologically no significance, and his
oft-quoted analogy between the Hellenic city-states and the Renaissance
republics very little, while the deeper truth in his comparison of Alcibiades
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>and Napoleon is accidental. Unlike the strict mathematician, who finds inner
relationships between two groups of differential equations where the layman
sees nothing but dissimilarities of outward form, Ranke and others draw their
historical analogies with a Plutarchian, popular-romantic, touch, and aim
merely at presenting comparable scenes on the world-stage.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is easy to see that, at bottom, it is neither a principle nor a sense of historic
necessity, but simple inclination, that governs the choice of the tableaux.
From any <em>technique</em> of analogies we are far distant. They throng up (to-day more
than ever) without scheme or unities, and if they do hit upon something which
is true—in the essential sense of the word that remains to be determined—it
is thanks to luck, more rarely to instinct, never to a principle. In this region
no one hitherto has set himself to work out a <em>method</em>, nor has had the
slightest inkling that there is here a root, in fact the only root, from which
can come a broad solution of the problems of History.</p>

<p class='c001'>Analogies, in so far as they laid bare the organic structure of history, might
be a blessing to historical thought. Their technique, developing under the influence
of a comprehensive idea, would surely eventuate in inevitable conclusions
and logical mastery. But as hitherto understood and practised they have
been a curse, for they have enabled the historians to follow their own tastes,
instead of soberly realizing that their first and hardest task was concerned with
the symbolism of history and its analogies, and, in consequence, the problem
has till now not even been comprehended, let alone solved. Superficial in many
cases (as for instance in designating Cæsar as the creator of the official newspaper),
these analogies are worse than superficial in others (as when phenomena
of the Classical Age that are not only extremely complex but utterly alien to
us are labelled with modern catchwords like Socialism, Impressionism, Capitalism,
Clericalism), while occasionally they are bizarre to the point of perversity—witness
the Jacobin clubs with their cult of Brutus, that millionaire-extortioner
Brutus who, in the name of oligarchical doctrine and with the
approval of the patrician senate, murdered the Man of the Democracy.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>III</h3>

<p class='c018'>Thus our theme, which originally comprised only the limited problem of
present-day civilization, broadens itself into a new philosophy—<em>the</em> philosophy
of the future, so far as the metaphysically-exhausted soil of the West
can bear such, and in any case the only philosophy which is within the
<em>possibilities</em> of the West-European mind in its next stages. It expands into the
conception of a <em>morphology of world history</em>, of the world-as-history in contrast to
the morphology of the world-as-nature that hitherto has been almost the only
theme of philosophy. And it reviews once again the forms and movements
of the world in their depths and final significance, but this time according to
an entirely different ordering which groups them, not in an ensemble picture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>inclusive of everything known, but in a picture of <em>life</em>, and presents them not
as things-become, but as things-becoming.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <em>world-as-history</em>, conceived, viewed and given form from out of its opposite
the <em>world-as-nature</em>—here is a new aspect of human existence on this earth.
As yet, in spite of its immense significance, both practical and theoretical, this
aspect has not been realized, still less presented. Some obscure inkling of it
there may have been, a distant momentary glimpse there has often been, but
no one has deliberately faced it and taken it in with all its implications. We
have before us two possible ways in which man may inwardly possess and experience
the world around him. With all rigour I distinguish (as to form, not
substance) the organic from the mechanical world-impression, the content of
images from that of laws, the picture and symbol from the formula and the
system, the instantly actual from the constantly possible, the intents and purposes
of imagination ordering according to plan from the intents and purposes
of experience dissecting according to scheme; and—to mention even thus early
an opposition that has never yet been noted, in spite of its significance—the
domain of <em>chronological</em> from that of <em>mathematical number</em>.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c019'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Consequently, in a research such as that lying before us, there can be no
question of taking spiritual-political events, as they become visible day by day
on the surface, at their face value, and arranging them on a scheme of “causes”
or “effects” and following them up in the obvious and intellectually easy
directions. Such a “pragmatic” handling of history would be nothing but a
piece of “natural science” in disguise, and for their part, the supporters of the
materialistic idea of history make no secret about it—it is their adversaries
who largely fail to see the similarity of the two methods. What concerns us is
not what the historical facts which appear at this or that time <em>are</em>, per se, but
what they signify, what they point to, <em>by appearing</em>. Present-day historians
think they are doing a work of supererogation in bringing in religious and social,
or still more art-history, details to “illustrate” the political sense of an
epoch. But the decisive factor—decisive, that is, in so far as visible history
is the expression, sign and embodiment of soul—they forget. I have not
hitherto found one who has carefully considered the <em>morphological relationship</em>
that inwardly binds together the expression-forms of <em>all</em> branches of a Culture,
who has gone beyond politics to grasp the ultimate and fundamental ideas of
Greeks, Arabians, Indians and Westerners in mathematics, the meaning of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>early ornamentation, the basic forms of their architecture, philosophies, dramas
and lyrics, their choice and development of great arts, the detail of their craftsmanship
and choice of materials—let alone appreciated the decisive importance
of these matters for the form-problems of history. Who amongst them realizes
that between the Differential Calculus and the dynastic principle of politics in
the age of Louis XIV, between the Classical city-state and the Euclidean
geometry, between the space-perspective of Western oil-painting and the conquest
of space by railroad, telephone and long-range weapon, between contrapuntal
music and credit economics, there are deep uniformities? Yet, viewed
from this morphological standpoint, even the humdrum facts of politics assume
a symbolic and even a metaphysical character, and—what has perhaps been
impossible hitherto—things such as the Egyptian administrative system, the
Classical coinage, analytical geometry, the cheque, the Suez Canal, the book-printing
of the Chinese, the Prussian Army, and the Roman road-engineering
can, as symbols, be made <em>uniformly</em> understandable and appreciable.</p>

<p class='c001'>But at once the fact presents itself that as yet there exists no theory-enlightened
art of historical treatment. What passes as such draws its methods
almost exclusively from the domain of that science which alone has completely
disciplined the methods of cognition, viz., physics, and thus we imagine ourselves
to be carrying on historical research when we are really following out
objective connexions of cause and effect. It is a remarkable fact that the old-fashioned
philosophy never imagined even the possibility of there being any
other relation than this between the conscious human understanding and the
world outside. Kant, who in his main work established the formal rules of
cognition, took <em>nature</em> only as the object of reason’s activity, and neither he
himself, nor anyone after him, noted the reservation. Knowledge, for Kant, is
mathematical knowledge. He deals with innate intuition-forms and categories
of the reason, but he never thinks of the wholly different mechanism by which
historical impressions are apprehended. And Schopenhauer, who, significantly
enough, retains but one of the Kantian categories, viz., causality, speaks contemptuously
of history.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c019'><sup>[2]</sup></a> That there is, besides a necessity of cause and effect—which
I may call the <em>logic of space</em>—another necessity, an organic necessity in
life, that of Destiny—the <em>logic of time</em>—is a fact of the deepest inward certainty,
a fact which suffuses the whole of mythological religions and artistic
thought and constitutes the essence and kernel of all history (in contradistinction
to nature) but is unapproachable through the cognition-forms which the
“Critique of Pure Reason” investigates. This fact still awaits its theoretical
formulation. As Galileo says in a famous passage of his <span lang="it"><cite>Saggiatore</cite></span>, philosophy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>as Nature’s great book, is written “in mathematical language.” We await,
to-day, the philosopher who will tell us in what language history is written
and how it is to be read.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mathematics and the principle of Causality lead to a <a id='corr8.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='naturalistic'>naturalistic,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_8.4'>naturalistic,</a></span> Chronology
and the idea of Destiny to a historical ordering of the phenomenal
world. Both orderings, each on its own account, cover the <em>whole</em>
world. The difference is only in the eyes by which and through which this
world is realized.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>IV</h3>

<p class='c018'>Nature is the shape in which the man of higher Cultures synthesizes and
interprets the immediate impressions of his senses. History is that from
which his imagination seeks comprehension of the living existence of the
world in relation to his own life, which he thereby invests with a deeper
reality. Whether he is capable of creating these shapes, which of them it is
that dominates his waking consciousness, is a primordial problem of all human
existence.</p>

<p class='c001'>Man, thus, has before him two <em>possibilities</em> of world-formation. But it must
be noted, at the very outset, that these possibilities are not necessarily <em>actualities</em>,
and if we are to enquire into the sense of all history we must begin by solving
a question which has never yet been put, viz., <em>for whom</em> is there History?
The question is seemingly paradoxical, for history is obviously for everyone to
this extent, that every man, with his whole existence and consciousness, is a
part of history. But it makes a great difference whether anyone lives under the
constant impression that his life is an element in a far wider life-course that
goes on for hundreds and thousands of years, or conceives of himself as something
rounded off and self-contained. For the latter type of consciousness there
is <a id='corr8.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='certaintly'>certainly</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_8.27'>certainly</a></span> no world-history, no <em>world-as-history</em>. But how if the self-consciousness
of a whole nation, how if a whole Culture rests on this ahistoric
spirit? How must actuality appear to it? The world? Life? Consider the
Classical Culture. In the world-consciousness of the Hellenes all experience,
not merely the personal but the common past, was immediately transmuted
into a timeless, immobile, mythically-fashioned background for the particular
momentary present; thus the history of Alexander the Great began even before
his death to be merged by Classical sentiment in the Dionysus legend, and to
Cæsar there seemed at the least nothing preposterous in claiming descent from
Venus.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such a spiritual condition it is practically impossible for us men of the West,
with a sense of time-distances so strong that we habitually and unquestioningly
speak of so many years before or after Christ, to reproduce in ourselves. But
we are not on that account entitled, in dealing with the problems of History,
simply to ignore the fact.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>What diaries and autobiographies yield in respect of an individual, that
historical research in the widest and most inclusive sense—that is, every kind
of psychological comparison and analysis of alien peoples, times and customs—yields
as to the soul of a Culture as a whole. But the Classical culture possessed
no <em>memory</em>, no organ of history in this special sense. The memory of the Classical
man—so to call it, though it is somewhat arbitrary to apply to alien souls
a notion derived from our own—is something different, since past and future,
as arraying perspectives in the working consciousness, are absent and the
“pure Present,” which so often roused Goethe’s admiration in every product
of the Classical life and in sculpture particularly, fills that life with an intensity
that to us is perfectly unknown.</p>

<p class='c001'>This pure Present, whose greatest symbol is the Doric column, in itself predicates
the <em>negation of time</em> (of direction). For Herodotus and Sophocles, as for
Themistocles or a Roman consul, the past is subtilized instantly into an impression
that is timeless and changeless, <em>polar and not periodic</em> in structure—in
the last analysis, of such stuff as myths are made of—whereas for our world-sense
and our inner eye the past is a definitely periodic and purposeful organism
of centuries or millennia.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it is just this background which gives the life, whether it be the Classical
or the Western life, its special colouring. What the Greek called Kosmos
was the image of a world that is not continuous but complete. <em>Inevitably</em>, then,
the Greek man himself was not a series but a term.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c019'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>For this reason, although Classical man was well acquainted with the
strict chronology and almanac-reckoning of the Babylonians and especially the
Egyptians, and therefore with that eternity-sense and disregard of the present-as-such
which revealed itself in their broadly-conceived operations of astronomy
and their exact measurements of big time-intervals, none of this ever became
<em>intimately</em> a part of him. What his philosophers occasionally told him on the
subject they had heard, not experienced, and what a few brilliant minds in the
Asiatic-Greek cities (such as Hipparchus and Aristarchus) discovered was rejected
alike by the Stoic and by the Aristotelian, and outside a small professional
circle not even noticed. Neither Plato nor Aristotle had an observatory.
In the last years of Pericles, the Athenian people passed a decree by which all
who propagated astronomical theories were made liable to impeachment
(εἰσαγγελία). This last was an act of the deepest symbolic significance, expressive
of the determination of the Classical soul to banish distance, in every
aspect, from its world-consciousness.</p>

<p class='c001'>As regards Classical history-writing, take Thucydides. The mastery of this
man lies in his truly Classical power of making alive and self-explanatory the
events of the <em>present</em>, and also in his possession of the magnificently <em>practical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>outlook</em> of the born statesman who has himself been both general and administrator.
In virtue of this quality of <em>experience</em> (which we unfortunately confuse
with the historical sense proper), his work confronts the merely learned and
professional historian as an inimitable model, and quite rightly so. But what
is absolutely hidden from Thucydides is perspective, the power of surveying
the history of centuries, that which for us is implicit in the very conception of
a historian. The fine pieces of Classical history-writing are invariably those
which set forth matters within the political present of the writer, whereas for
us it is the direct opposite, our historical masterpieces without exception being
those which deal with a distant past. Thucydides would have broken down
in handling even the Persian Wars, let alone the general history of Greece,
while that of Egypt would have been utterly out of his reach. He, as well as
Polybius and Tacitus (who like him were practical politicians), loses his sureness
of eye from the moment when, in looking backwards, he encounters motive
forces in any form that is unknown in his practical experience. For Polybius
even the First Punic War, for Tacitus even the reign of Augustus, are inexplicable.
As for Thucydides, his lack of historical feeling—in our sense of the
phrase—is conclusively demonstrated on the very first page of his book by
the astounding statement that before his time (about 400 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>) no events of
importance had occurred (oὐ μεγάλα γενέσθαι) in the world!<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c019'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Consequently, Classical history down to the Persian Wars and for that
matter the structure built up on traditions at much later periods, are the product
of an essentially mythological thinking. The constitutional history of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Sparta is a poem of the Hellenistic period, and Lycurgus, on whom it centres
and whose “biography” we are given in full detail, was probably in the
beginning an unimportant local god of Mount Taygetus. The invention of
pre-Hannibalian Roman history was still going on even in Cæsar’s time. The
story of the expulsion of the Tarquins by Brutus is built round some contemporary
of the Censor Appius Claudius (310 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>). The names of the Roman
kings were at that period made up from the names of certain plebeian families
which had become wealthy (K. J. Neumann). In the sphere of constitutional
history, setting aside altogether the “constitution” of Servius Tullius, we
find that even the famous land law of Licinius (367 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>) was not in existence
at the time of the Second Punic War (B. Niese). When Epaminondas gave
freedom and statehood to the Messenians and the Arcadians, these peoples
promptly provided themselves with an early history. But the astounding
thing is not that history of this sort was produced, but that there was practically
none of any other sort; and the opposition between the Classical and
the modern outlook is sufficiently illustrated by saying that Roman history
before 250 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, as known in Cæsar’s time, was substantially a forgery, and that
the little that we know has been established by ourselves and was entirely
unknown to the later Romans. In what sense the Classical world understood
the word “history” we can see from the fact that the Alexandrine romance-literature
exercised the strongest influence upon serious political and religious
history, even as regards its matter. It never entered the Classical head to draw
any distinction of principle between history as a story and history as documents.
When, towards the end of the Roman republic, Varro set out to stabilize
the religion that was fast vanishing from the people’s consciousness, he
classified the deities <em>whose cult was exactly and minutely observed by the State</em>, into
“certain” and “uncertain” gods, i.e., into gods of whom something was still
known and gods that, in spite of the unbroken continuity of official worship,
had survived in name only. In actual fact, the religion of Roman society in
Varro’s time, the poet’s religion which Goethe and even Nietzsche reproduced
in all innocence, was mainly a product of Hellenistic literature and had almost
no relation to the ancient practices, which no one any longer understood.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mommsen clearly defined the West-European attitude towards this history
when he said that “the Roman historians,” meaning especially Tacitus, “were
men who said what it would have been meritorious to omit, and omitted what
it was essential to say.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In the Indian Culture we have the perfectly ahistoric soul. Its decisive expression
is the Brahman Nirvana. There is no pure Indian astronomy, no
calendar, and therefore no history so far as history is the track of a conscious
spiritual evolution. Of the visible course of their Culture, which as regards its
organic phase came to an end with the rise of Buddhism, we know even less
than we do of Classical history, rich though it must have been in great events
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>between the 12th and 8th centuries. And this is not surprising, since it was in
dream-shapes and mythological figures that both came to be fixed. It is a full
millennium after Buddha, about 500 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, when Ceylon first produces something
remotely resembling historical work, the “Mahavansa.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The world-consciousness of Indian man was so ahistorically built that it
could not even treat the appearance of a book written by a single author as an
event determinate in time. Instead of an organic series of writings by specific
persons, there came into being gradually a vague mass of texts into which
everyone inserted what he pleased, and notions such as those of intellectual
individualism, intellectual evolution, intellectual epochs, played no part in the
matter. It is in this <em>anonymous</em> form that we possess the Indian philosophy—which
is at the same time all the Indian history that we have—and it is instructive
to compare with it the philosophy-history of the West, which is a
perfectly definite structure made up of individual books and personalities.</p>

<p class='c001'>Indian man forgot everything, but Egyptian man forgot <em>nothing</em>. Hence,
while the art of portraiture—which is biography in the kernel—was unknown
in India, in Egypt it was practically the artist’s only theme.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Egyptian soul, conspicuously historical in its texture and impelled
with primitive passion towards the infinite, perceived past and future as its
<em>whole</em> world, and the present (which is identical with waking consciousness)
appeared to him simply as the narrow common frontier of two immeasurable
stretches. The Egyptian Culture is an embodiment of <em>care</em>—which is the
spiritual counterpoise of distance—care for the future expressed in the choice
of granite or basalt as the craftsman’s materials,<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c019'><sup>[5]</sup></a> in the chiselled archives, in
the elaborate administrative system, in the net of irrigation works,<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c019'><sup>[6]</sup></a> and,
necessarily <em>bound up therewith</em>, care for the past. The Egyptian mummy is a
symbol of the first importance. The body of the dead man was <em>made everlasting</em>,
just as his personality, his “Ka,” was immortalized through the portrait-statuettes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>which were often made in many copies and to which it was conceived
to be attached by a transcendental likeness.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is a deep relation between the attitude that is taken towards the
historic past and the conception that is formed of death, and this relation is
expressed in the <em>disposal of the dead</em>. The Egyptian denied mortality, the
Classical man affirmed it in the whole symbolism of his Culture. The Egyptians
embalmed even their history in chronological dates and figures. From
pre-Solonian Greece nothing has been handed down, not a year-date, not a true
name, not a tangible event—with the consequence that the later history,
(which alone we know) assumes undue importance—but for Egypt we possess,
from the 3rd millennium and even earlier, the names and even the exact reign-dates
of many of the kings, and the New Empire must have had a complete
knowledge of them. To-day, pathetic symbols of the will to endure, the
bodies of the great Pharaohs lie in our museums, their faces still recognizable.
On the shining, polished-granite peak of the pyramid of Amenemhet III we can
read to-day the words “Amenemhet looks upon the beauty of the Sun” and,
on the other side, “Higher is the soul of Amenemhet than the height of Orion,
and it is united with the underworld.” Here indeed is victory over Mortality
and the mere present; it is to the last degree un-Classical.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>V</h3>

<p class='c018'>In opposition to this mighty group of Egyptian life-symbols, we meet at the
threshold of the Classical Culture the custom, typifying the ease with which it
could forget every piece of its inward and outward past, of <em>burning the dead</em>. To
the Mycenæan age the elevation into a ritual of this particular funerary method
amongst all those practised in turn by stone-age peoples, was essentially alien;
indeed its Royal tombs suggest that earth-burial was regarded as peculiarly
honourable. But in Homeric Greece, as in Vedic India, we find a change, so
sudden that its origins must necessarily be psychological, from burial to that
burning which (the Iliad gives us the full pathos of the symbolic act) was the
ceremonial completion of death and the denial of all historical duration.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this moment the plasticity of the individual spiritual evolution was
at an end. Classical drama admitted truly historical motives just as little as it
allowed themes of inward evolution, and it is well known how decisively the
Hellenic instinct set itself against portraiture in the arts. Right into the imperial
period Classical art handled only the matter that was, so to say, natural
to it, the myth.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c019'><sup>[7]</sup></a> Even the “ideal” portraits of Hellenistic sculpture are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>mythical, of the same kind as the typical biographies of Plutarch’s sort. No
great Greek ever wrote down any recollections that would serve to fix a
phase of experience for his inner eye. Not even Socrates has told, regarding
his inward life, anything important in our sense of the word. It is questionable
indeed whether for a Classical mind it was even possible to react
to the motive forces that are presupposed in the production of a Parzeval,
a Hamlet, or a Werther. In Plato we fail to observe any conscious evolution
of doctrine; his separate works are merely treatises written from very
different standpoints which he took up from time to time, and it gave
him no concern whether and how they hung together. On the contrary, a
work of deep self-examination, the <span lang="it"><cite>Vita Nuova</cite></span> of Dante, is found at the
very outset of the spiritual history of the West. How little therefore of the
Classical pure-present there really was in Goethe, the man who forgot nothing,
the man whose works, as he avowed himself, are only fragments of a <em>single
great confession</em>!</p>

<p class='c001'>After the destruction of Athens by the Persians, all the older art-works were
thrown on the dustheap (whence we are now extracting them), and we do not
hear that anyone in Hellas ever troubled himself about the ruins of Mycenæ or
Phaistos for the purpose of ascertaining historical facts. Men read Homer but
never thought of excavating the hill of Troy as Schliemann did; for what they
wanted was myth, not history. The works of Æschylus and those of the pre-Socratic
philosophers were already partially lost in the Hellenistic period.
In the West, on the contrary, the piety inherent in and peculiar to the Culture
manifested itself, five centuries before Schliemann, in Petrarch—the fine
collector of antiquities, coins and manuscripts, the very type of historically-sensitive
man, viewing the distant past and scanning the distant prospect (was
he not the first to attempt an Alpine peak?), living in his time, yet essentially
not of it. The soul of the collector is intelligible only by having regard to his
conception of Time. Even more passionate perhaps, though of a different
colouring, is the collecting-bent of the Chinese. In China, whoever travels
assiduously pursues “old traces” (Ku-tsi) and the untranslatable “Tao,” the
basic principle of Chinese existence, derives all its meaning from a deep historical
feeling. In the Hellenistic period, objects were indeed collected and
displayed everywhere, but they were curiosities of mythological appeal (as
described by Pausanias) as to which questions of date or purpose simply did
not arise—and this too in the very presence of Egypt, which even by the time
of the great Thuthmosis had been transformed into one vast museum of strict
tradition.</p>

<p class='c001'>Amongst the Western peoples, it was the Germans who discovered the
mechanical <em>clock</em>, the dread symbol of the flow of time, and the chimes of
countless clock towers that echo day and night over West Europe are
perhaps the most wonderful expression of which a historical world-feeling is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>capable.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c019'><sup>[8]</sup></a> In the timeless countrysides and cities of the Classical world, we find
nothing of the sort. Till the epoch of Pericles, the time of day was estimated
merely by the length of shadow, and it was only from that of Aristotle that
the word ὥρα received the (Babylonian) significance of “hour”; prior to that
there was no exact subdivision of the day. In Babylon and Egypt water-clocks
and sun-dials were discovered in the very early stages, yet in Athens it was
left to Plato to introduce a practically useful form of clepsydra, and this was
merely a minor adjunct of everyday utility which could not have influenced
the Classical life-feeling in the smallest degree.</p>

<p class='c001'>It remains still to mention the corresponding difference, which is very deep
and has never yet been properly appreciated, between Classical and modern
mathematics. The former conceived of things <em>as they are</em>, as <em>magnitudes</em>, timeless
and purely present, and so it proceeded to Euclidean geometry and mathematical
statics, rounding off its intellectual system with the theory of conic sections.
We conceive things as they <em>become</em> and <em>behave</em>, as <em>function</em>, and this brought us to
dynamics, analytical geometry and thence to the Differential Calculus.<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c019'><sup>[9]</sup></a> The
modern theory of functions is the imposing marshalling of this whole mass of
thought. It is a bizarre, but nevertheless psychologically exact, fact that the
physics of the Greeks—being statics and not dynamics—neither knew the
use nor felt the absence of the time-element, whereas we on the other hand work
in thousandths of a second. The one and only evolution-idea that is timeless,
ahistoric, is Aristotle’s entelechy.</p>

<p class='c001'>This, then, is our task. We men of the Western Culture are, with our historical
sense, an exception and not a rule. World-history is <em>our</em> world picture
and not all mankind’s. Indian and Classical man formed no image of a world in
progress, and perhaps when in due course the civilization of the West is extinguished,
there will never again be a Culture and a human type in which
“world-history” is so potent a form of the waking consciousness.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>VI</h3>

<p class='c018'>What, then, <em>is</em> world-history? Certainly, an ordered presentation of the past,
an inner postulate, the expression of a capacity for feeling form. But a feeling
for form, however definite, is not the same as form itself. No doubt we feel
world-history, experience it, and believe that it is to be read just as a map is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>read. But, even to-day, it is only forms of it that we know and not <em>the</em> form of
it, which is the mirror-image of <em>our own</em> inner life.</p>

<p class='c001'>Everyone of course, if asked, would say that he saw the inward form of
History quite clearly and definitely. The illusion subsists because no one has
seriously reflected on it, still less conceived doubts as to his own knowledge,
for no one has the slightest notion how wide a field for doubt there is. In fact,
the <em>lay-out</em> of world-history is an unproved and subjective notion that has been
handed down from generation to generation (not only of laymen but of professional
historians) and stands badly in need of a little of that scepticism which
from Galileo onward has regulated and deepened our inborn ideas of nature.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thanks to the subdivision of history into “Ancient,” “Mediæval” and
“Modern”—an incredibly jejune and <em>meaningless</em> scheme, which has, however,
entirely dominated our historical thinking—we have failed to perceive the
true position in the general history of higher mankind, of the little part-world
which has developed on West-European<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c019'><sup>[10]</sup></a> soil from the time of the German-Roman
Empire, to judge of its relative importance and above all to estimate its
direction. The Cultures that are to come will find it difficult to believe that the
validity of such a scheme with its simple rectilinear progression and its meaningless
proportions, becoming more and more preposterous with each century,
incapable of bringing into itself the new fields of history as they successively
come into the light of our knowledge, was, in spite of all, never whole-heartedly
attacked. The criticisms that it has long been the fashion of historical researchers
to level at the scheme mean nothing; they have only obliterated the
one existing plan without substituting for it any other. To toy with phrases
such as “the Greek Middle Ages” or “Germanic antiquity” does not in the
least help us to form a clear and inwardly-convincing picture in which China
and Mexico, the empire of Axum and that of the Sassanids have their proper
places. And the expedient of shifting the initial point of “modern history”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>from the Crusades to the Renaissance, or from the Renaissance to the beginning
of the 19th Century, only goes to show that the scheme <span lang="la"><i>per se</i></span> is regarded as unshakably
sound.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not only that the scheme circumscribes the area of history. What is
worse, it rigs the stage. The ground of West Europe is treated as a steady pole,
a unique patch chosen on the surface of the sphere for no better reason, it
seems, than because we live on it—and great histories of millennial duration
and mighty far-away Cultures are made to revolve around this pole in all
modesty. It is a quaintly conceived system of sun and planets! We select a
single bit of ground as the natural centre of the historical system, and make it
the central sun. From it all the events of history receive their real light, from
it their importance is judged in <em>perspective</em>. But it is in our own West-European
conceit alone that this phantom “world-history,” which a breath of scepticism
would dissipate, is acted out.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have to thank that conceit for the immense optical illusion (become
natural from long habit) whereby distant histories of thousands of years, such
as those of China and Egypt, are made to shrink to the dimensions of mere
episodes while in the neighbourhood of our own position the decades since
Luther, and particularly since Napoleon, loom large as Brocken-spectres. We
know quite well that the slowness with which a high cloud or a railway train
in the distance seems to move is only apparent, yet we believe that the <em>tempo</em> of
all early Indian, Babylonian or Egyptian history was really slower than that of
our own recent past. And we think of them as less substantial, more damped-down,
more diluted, because we have not learned to make the allowance for
(inward and outward) distances.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is self-evident that for the Cultures of the West the existence of Athens,
Florence or Paris is more important than that of Lo-Yang or Pataliputra. But
is it permissible to found a scheme of world-history on estimates of such a sort?
If so, then the Chinese historian is quite entitled to frame a world-history in
which the Crusades, the Renaissance, Cæsar and Frederick the Great are passed
over in silence as insignificant. How, <em>from the morphological point of view</em>, should
our 18th Century be more important than any other of the sixty centuries that
preceded it? Is it not ridiculous to oppose a “modern” history of a few centuries,
and that history to all intents localized in West Europe, to an “ancient”
history which covers as many millennia—incidentally dumping into that
“ancient history” the whole mass of the pre-Hellenic cultures, unprobed and
unordered, as mere appendix-matter? This is no exaggeration. Do we not, for
the sake of keeping the hoary scheme, dispose of Egypt and Babylon—each as
an individual and self-contained history quite equal in the balance to our so-called
“world-history” from Charlemagne to the World-War and well beyond
it—as a <em>prelude</em> to classical history? Do we not relegate the vast complexes
of Indian and Chinese culture to foot-notes, with a gesture of embarrassment?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>As for the great American cultures, do we not, on the ground that they do not
“fit in” (with what?), entirely ignore them?</p>

<p class='c001'>The most appropriate designation for this current West-European scheme of
history, in which the great Cultures are made to follow orbits round <em>us</em> as the
presumed centre of all world-happenings, is the <em>Ptolemaic system</em> of history.
The system that is put forward in this work in place of it I regard as the <em>Copernican
discovery</em> in the historical sphere, in that it admits no sort of privileged
position to the Classical or the Western Culture as against the Cultures of India,
Babylon, China, Egypt, the Arabs, Mexico—separate worlds of dynamic
being which in point of mass count for just as much in the general picture of
history as the Classical, while frequently surpassing it in point of spiritual
greatness and soaring power.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>VII</h3>

<p class='c018'>The scheme “ancient-mediæval-modern” in its first form was a creation of
the Magian world-sense. It first appeared in the Persian and Jewish religions
after Cyrus,<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c019'><sup>[11]</sup></a> received an apocalyptic sense in the teaching of the Book of Daniel
on the four world-eras, and was developed into a world-history in the post-Christian
religions of the East, notably the Gnostic systems.<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c019'><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This important conception, within the very narrow limits which fixed its
intellectual basis, was unimpeachable. Neither Indian nor even Egyptian history
was included in the scope of the proposition. For the Magian thinker the
expression “world-history” meant a unique and supremely dramatic act, having
as its theatre the lands between Hellas and Persia, in which the strictly
dualistic world-sense of the East expressed itself not by means of polar conceptions
like the “soul and spirit,” “good and evil” of contemporary metaphysics,
but by the figure of a catastrophe, an epochal change of phase between
world-creation and world-decay.<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c019'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>No elements beyond those which we find stabilized in the Classical literature,
on the one hand, and the Bible (or other sacred book of the particular system),
on the other, came into the picture, which presents (as “The Old” and
“The New,” respectively) the easily-grasped contrasts of Gentile and Jewish,
Christian and Heathen, Classical and Oriental, idol and dogma, nature and spirit
<em>with a time connotation</em>—that is, as a drama in which the one prevails over the
other. The historical change of period wears the characteristic dress of the
religious “Redemption.” This “world-history” in short was a conception
narrow and provincial, but within its limits logical and complete. Necessarily,
therefore, it was specific to this region and this humanity, and incapable of any
<em>natural</em> extension.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>But to these two there has been added a third epoch, the epoch that we call
“modern,” on Western soil, and it is this that for the first time gives the picture
of history the look of a progression. The oriental picture was <em>at rest</em>. It
presented a self-contained antithesis, with equilibrium as its outcome and a
unique divine act as its turning-point. But, adopted and assumed by a wholly
new type of mankind, it was quickly transformed (without anyone’s noticing
the oddity of the change) into a conception of a <em>linear progress</em>: from Homer or
Adam—the modern can substitute for these names the Indo-German, Old
Stone Man, or the Pithecanthropus—through Jerusalem, Rome, Florence and
Paris according to the taste of the individual historian, thinker or artist, who
has unlimited freedom in the interpretation of the three-part scheme.</p>

<p class='c001'>This third term, “modern times,” which in form asserts that it is the last
and conclusive term of the series, has in fact, ever since the Crusades, been
stretched and stretched again to the elastic limit at which it will bear no more.<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c019'><sup>[14]</sup></a>
It was at least implied if not stated in so many words, that here, beyond the ancient
and the mediæval, something definitive was beginning, a Third Kingdom
in which, somewhere, there was to be fulfilment and culmination, and which
had an objective point.</p>

<p class='c001'>As to what this objective point is, each thinker, from Schoolman to present-day
Socialist, backs his own peculiar discovery. Such a view into the course of
things may be both easy and flattering to the patentee, but in fact he has simply
taken the spirit of the West, as reflected in his own brain, for the meaning of the
world. So it is that great thinkers, making a metaphysical virtue of intellectual
necessity, have not only accepted without serious investigation the scheme of
history agreed “by common consent” but have made of it the basis of their
philosophies and dragged in God as author of this or that “world-plan.”
Evidently the mystic number three applied to the world-ages has something
highly seductive for the metaphysician’s taste. History was described by
Herder as the education of the human race, by Kant as an evolution of the idea
of freedom, by Hegel as a self-expansion of the world-spirit, by others in other
terms, but as regards its ground-plan everyone was quite satisfied when he had
thought out some abstract meaning for the conventional threefold order.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the very threshold of the Western Culture we meet the great Joachim of
Floris (c. 1145-1202),<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c019'><sup>[15]</sup></a> the first thinker of the Hegelian stamp who shattered
the dualistic world-form of Augustine, and with his essentially Gothic intellect
stated the new Christianity of his time in the form of a third term to the
religions of the Old and the New Testaments, expressing them respectively as
the Age of the Father, the Age of the Son and the Age of the Holy Ghost. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>teaching moved the best of the Franciscans and the Dominicans, Dante, Thomas
Aquinas, in their inmost souls and awakened a world-outlook which slowly
but surely took entire possession of the historical sense of our Culture. Lessing—who
often designated his own period, with reference to the Classical as the
“after-world”<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c019'><sup>[16]</sup></a> (Nachwelt)—took his idea of the “education of the human
race” with its three stages of child, youth and man, from the teaching of the
Fourteenth Century mystics. Ibsen treats it with thoroughness in his <cite>Emperor
and Galilean</cite> (1873), in which he directly presents the Gnostic world-conception
through the figure of the wizard Maximus, and advances not a step beyond
it in his famous Stockholm address of 1887. It would appear, then, that the
Western consciousness feels itself urged to predicate a sort of finality inherent
in its own appearance.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the creation of the Abbot of Floris was a <em>mystical</em> glance into the secrets
of the divine world-order. It was bound to lose all meaning as soon as it was
used in the way of reasoning and made a hypothesis of <em>scientific</em> thinking, as it
has been—ever more and more frequently—since the 17th Century.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is a quite indefensible method of presenting world-history to begin by
giving rein to one’s own religious, political or social convictions and endowing
the sacrosanct three-phase system with tendencies that will bring it exactly to
one’s own standpoint. This is, in effect, making of some formula—say, the
“Age of Reason,” Humanity, the greatest happiness of the greatest number,
enlightenment, economic progress, national freedom, the conquest of nature,
or world-peace—a criterion whereby to judge whole millennia of history.
And so we judge that they were ignorant of the “true path,” or that they failed
to follow it, when the fact is simply that their will and purposes were not the
same as ours. Goethe’s saying, “What is important in life is life and not a
result of life,” is the answer to any and every senseless attempt to solve the
riddle of historical form by means of a <em>programme</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is the same picture that we find when we turn to the historians of each
special art or science (and those of national economics and philosophy as well).
We find:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c020'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in1'>“Painting” from the Egyptians (or the cave-men) to the Impressionists, or</div>

      <div class='line'>be,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>presented as a linear graph which steadily rises in conformity with the values
of the (selected) arguments. No one has seriously considered the possibility
that arts may have an allotted span of life and may be attached as forms
of self-expression to particular regions and particular types of mankind, and
that therefore the total history of an art may be merely an additive compilation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>of separate developments, of special arts, with no bond of union save the name
and some details of craft-technique.</p>

<p class='c001'>We know it to be true of every organism that the rhythm, form and duration
of its life, and all the expression-details of that life as well, are determined by
the <em>properties of its species</em>. No one, looking at the oak, with its millennial life,
dare say that it is at this moment, now, about to start on its true and proper
course. No one as he sees a caterpillar grow day by day expects that it will
go on doing so for two or three years. In these cases we feel, with an unqualified
certainty, a <em>limit</em>, and this sense of the limit is identical with our sense of the
inward form. In the case of higher human history, on the contrary, we take our
ideas as to the course of the future from an unbridled optimism that sets at
naught all historical, i.e., <em>organic</em>, experience, and everyone therefore sets himself
to discover in the accidental present terms that he can expand into some
striking progression-series, the existence of which rests not on scientific proof
but on predilection. He works upon unlimited possibilities—never a natural
end—and from the momentary top-course of his bricks plans artlessly the
continuation of his structure.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mankind,” however, has no aim, no idea, no plan, any more than the
family of butterflies or orchids. “Mankind” is a zoological expression, or an
empty word.<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c019'><sup>[17]</sup></a> But conjure away the phantom, break the magic circle, and at
once there emerges an astonishing wealth of <em>actual</em> forms—the Living with all
its immense fullness, depth and movement—hitherto veiled by a catchword,
a dryasdust scheme, and a set of personal “ideals.” I see, in place of that empty
figment of <em>one</em> linear history which can only be kept up by shutting one’s eyes
to the overwhelming multitude of the facts, the drama of <em>a number</em> of mighty
Cultures, each springing with primitive strength from the soil of a mother-region
to which it remains firmly bound throughout its whole life-cycle; each
stamping its material, its mankind, in <em>its own image</em>; each having <em>its own</em> idea, <em>its
own</em> passions, <em>its own</em> life, will and feeling, <em>its own</em> death. Here indeed are colours,
lights, movements, that no intellectual eye has yet discovered. Here the Cultures,
peoples, languages, truths, gods, landscapes bloom and age as the oaks
and the stone-pines, the blossoms, twigs and leaves—but there is no ageing
“Mankind.” Each Culture has its own new possibilities of self-expression
which arise, ripen, decay, and never return. There is not <em>one</em> sculpture, <em>one</em> painting,
<em>one</em> mathematics, <em>one</em> physics, but many, each in its deepest essence different
from the others, each limited in duration and self-contained, just as each species
of plant has its peculiar blossom or fruit, its special type of growth and decline.
These cultures, sublimated life-essences, grow with the same superb aimlessness
as the flowers of the field. They belong, like the plants and the animals, to the
living Nature of Goethe, and not to the dead Nature of Newton. I see world-history
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>as a picture of endless formations and transformations, of the marvellous
waxing and waning of organic forms. The professional historian, on the contrary,
sees it as a sort of tapeworm industriously adding on to itself one epoch
after another.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the series “ancient-mediæval-modern history” has at last exhausted its
usefulness. Angular, narrow, shallow though it was as a scientific foundation,
still we possessed no other form that was not wholly unphilosophical in which
our data could be arranged, and world-history (as hitherto understood) has to
thank it for filtering our classifiable solid residues. But the number of centuries
that the scheme can by any stretch be made to cover has long since been exceeded,
and with the rapid increase in the volume of our historical material—especially
of material that cannot possibly be brought under the scheme—the
picture is beginning to dissolve into a chaotic blur. Every historical student
who is not quite blind knows and feels this, and it is as a drowning man that he
clutches at the only scheme which he knows of. The word “Middle Age,”<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c019'><sup>[18]</sup></a>
invented in 1667 by Professor Horn of Leyden, has to-day to cover a formless
and constantly extending mass which can only be defined, negatively, as every
thing not classifiable under any pretext in one of the other two (tolerably well-ordered)
groups. We have an excellent example of this in our feeble treatment
and hesitant judgment of modern Persian, Arabian and Russian history. But,
above all, it has become impossible to conceal the fact that this so-called history
of the world is a limited history, first of the Eastern Mediterranean region and
then,—with an abrupt change of scene at the Migrations (an event important
only to us and therefore greatly exaggerated by us, an event of purely Western
and not even Arabian significance),—of West-Central Europe. When Hegel declared
so naïvely that he meant to ignore those peoples which did not fit into
his scheme of history, he was only making an honest avowal of methodic
premisses that every historian finds necessary for his purpose and every historical
work shows in its lay-out. In fact it has now become an affair of
scientific tact to determine which of the historical developments shall be
<em>seriously</em> taken into account and which not. Ranke is a good example.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>VIII</h3>

<p class='c018'>To-day we think in continents, and it is only our philosophers and historians
who have not realized that we do so. Of what significance to us, then, are conceptions
and purviews that they put before us as universally valid, when in
truth their furthest horizon does not extend beyond the intellectual atmosphere
of Western Man?</p>

<p class='c001'>Examine, from this point of view, our best books. When Plato speaks of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>humanity, he means the Hellenes in contrast to the barbarians, which is entirely
consonant with the ahistoric mode of the Classical life and thought, and his
premisses take him to conclusions that <em>for Greeks</em> were complete and significant.
When, however, Kant philosophizes, say on ethical ideas, he maintains the
validity of his theses for men of all times and places. He does not say this in
so many words, for, for himself and his readers, it is something that goes without
saying. In his æsthetics he formulates the principles, not of Phidias’s art,
or Rembrandt’s art, but of Art generally. But what he poses as necessary forms
of thought are in reality only necessary forms of Western thought, though a
glance at Aristotle and his essentially different conclusions should have sufficed
to show that Aristotle’s intellect, not less penetrating than his own, was of
different structure from it. The categories of the Westerner are just as alien to
Russian thought as those of the Chinaman or the ancient Greek are to him. For
us, the effective and complete comprehension of Classical root-words is just as
impossible as that of Russian<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c019'><sup>[19]</sup></a> and Indian, and for the modern Chinese or Arab,
with their utterly different intellectual constitutions, “philosophy from Bacon
to Kant” has only a curiosity-value.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is <em>this</em> that is lacking to the Western thinker, the very thinker in whom
we might have expected to find it—insight into the <em>historically relative</em> character
of his data, which are expressions of one <em>specific existence and one only</em>;
knowledge of the necessary limits of their validity; the conviction that his
“unshakable” truths and “eternal” views are simply true for him and eternal
for his world-view; the duty of looking beyond them to find out what the men
of other Cultures have with equal certainty evolved out of themselves. That
and nothing else will impart completeness to the philosophy of the future, and
only through an understanding of the living world shall we understand the
symbolism of history. Here there is nothing constant, nothing universal. We
must cease to speak of the forms of “Thought,” the principles of “Tragedy,”
the mission of “The State.” Universal validity involves always the fallacy of
arguing from particular to particular.</p>

<p class='c001'>But something much more disquieting than a logical fallacy begins to appear
when the centre of gravity of philosophy shifts from the abstract-systematic
to the practical-ethical and our Western thinkers from Schopenhauer onward
turn from the problem of cognition to the problem of life (the will to life, to
power, to action). Here it is not the ideal abstract “man” of Kant that is
subjected to examination, but actual man as he has inhabited the earth during
historical time, grouped, whether primitive or advanced, by peoples; and it is
more than ever futile to define the structure of his highest ideas in terms of the
“ancient-mediæval-modern” scheme with its local limitations. But it is done,
nevertheless.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>Consider the historical horizon of Nietzsche. His conceptions of decadence,
militarism, the transvaluation of all values, the will to power, lie deep in the
essence of Western civilization and are for the analysis of that civilization of
decisive importance. But what, do we find, was the foundation on which he
built up his creation? Romans and Greeks, Renaissance and European present,
with a fleeting and uncomprehending side-glance at Indian philosophy—in
short “ancient, mediæval and modern” history. Strictly speaking, he never
once moved outside the scheme, not did any other thinker of his time.</p>

<p class='c001'>What correlation, then, is there or can there be of his idea of the “Dionysian”
with the inner life of a highly-civilized Chinese or an up-to-date American?
What is the significance of his type of the “Superman”—for the world
of Islam? Can image-forming antitheses of Nature and Intellect, Heathen and
Christian, Classical and Modern, have any meaning for the soul of the Indian
or the Russian? What can Tolstoi—who from the depths of his humanity
rejected the whole Western world-idea as something alien and distant—<em>do</em>
with the “Middle Ages,” with Dante, with Luther? What can a Japanese do
with Parzeval and “Zarathustra,” or an Indian with Sophocles? And is the
thought-range of Schopenhauer, Comte, Feuerbach, Hebbel or Strindberg any
wider? Is not their whole psychology, for all its intention of world-wide
validity, one of purely West-European significance?</p>

<p class='c001'>How comic seem Ibsen’s woman-problems—which also challenge the
attention of all “humanity”—when, for his famous Nora, the lady of the
North-west European city with the horizon that is implied by a house-rent
of £100 to £300 a year and a Protestant upbringing, we substitute Cæsar’s wife,
Madame de Sévigné, a Japanese or a Turkish peasant woman! But, for that
matter, Ibsen’s own circle of vision is that of the middle class in a great city of
yesterday and to-day. His conflicts, which start from spiritual premisses that
did not exist till about 1850 and can scarcely last beyond 1950, are neither those
of the great world nor those of the lower masses, still less those of the cities inhabited
by non-European populations.</p>

<p class='c001'>All these are local and temporary values—most of them indeed limited
to the momentary “intelligentsia” of cities of West-European type. World-historical
or “eternal” values they emphatically are not. Whatever the substantial
importance of Ibsen’s and Nietzsche’s generation may be, it infringes
the very meaning of the word “world-history”—which denotes the totality
and not a selected part—to subordinate, to undervalue, or to ignore the factors
which lie outside “modern” interests. Yet in fact they are so undervalued or
ignored to an amazing extent. What the West has said and thought, hitherto,
on the problems of space, time, motion, number, will, marriage, property,
tragedy, science, has remained narrow and dubious, because men were always
looking for <em>the</em> solution of <em>the</em> question. It was never seen that many questioners
implies many answers, that any philosophical question is really a veiled desire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>to get an explicit affirmation of what is implicit in the question itself, that the
great questions of any period are fluid beyond all conception, and that therefore
it is only by obtaining a <em>group of historically limited solutions</em> and measuring it by
<em>utterly impersonal</em> criteria that the final secrets can be reached. The real student
of mankind treats no standpoint as absolutely right or absolutely wrong. In
the face of such grave problems as that of Time or that of Marriage, it is insufficient
to appeal to personal experience, or an inner voice, or reason, or the
opinion of ancestors or contemporaries. These may say what is true for the
questioner himself and for his time, but that is not all. In other Cultures the
phenomenon talks a different language, for other men there are different truths.
The <em>thinker</em> must admit the validity of all, or of none.</p>

<p class='c001'>How greatly, then, Western world-criticism can be widened and deepened!
How immensely far beyond the innocent relativism of Nietzsche and his generation
one must look—how fine one’s sense for form and one’s psychological
insight must become—how completely one must free oneself from limitations
of self, of practical interests, of horizon—before one dare assert the pretension
to understand world-history, the <em>world-as-history</em>.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>IX</h3>

<p class='c018'>In opposition to all these <a id='corr25.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='arbitary'>arbitrary</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_25.19'>arbitrary</a></span> and narrow schemes, derived from tradition
or personal choice, into which history is forced, I put forward the natural,
the “Copernican,” form of the historical process which lies deep in the essence
of that process and reveals itself only to an eye perfectly free from prepossessions.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such an eye was Goethe’s. That which Goethe called <em>Living Nature</em> is
exactly that which we are calling here world-history, <em>world-as-history</em>. Goethe,
who as artist portrayed the life and development, always the life and development,
of his figures, the thing-becoming and not the thing-become (“Wilhelm
Meister” and <span lang="la">“Wahrheit und Dichtung”</span>) hated Mathematics. For him, the
world-as-mechanism stood opposed to the world-as-organism, dead nature to
living nature, law to form. As naturalist, every line he wrote was meant to
display the image of a thing-becoming, the “impressed form” living and developing.
Sympathy, observation, comparison, immediate and inward certainty,
intellectual <em>flair</em>—these were the means whereby he was enabled to
approach the secrets of the phenomenal world in motion. <em>Now these are the means
of historical research</em>—precisely these and no others. It was this <em>godlike</em> insight
that prompted him to say at the bivouac fire on the evening of the Battle of
Valmy: “Here and now begins a new epoch of world history, and you, gentlemen,
can say that you ‘were there.’” No general, no diplomat, let alone the
philosophers, ever so directly felt history “becoming.” It is the deepest judgment
that any man ever uttered about a great historical act in the moment of
its accomplishment.</p>

<p class='c001'>And just as he followed out the development of the plant-form from the leaf,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>the birth of the vertebrate type, the process of the geological strata—<em>the
Destiny in nature and not the Causality</em>—so here we shall develop the form-language
of human history, its periodic structure, its <em>organic logic</em> out of the
profusion of all the challenging details.</p>

<p class='c001'>In other aspects, mankind is habitually, and rightly, reckoned as one of the
organisms of the earth’s surface. Its physical structure, its natural functions,
the whole phenomenal conception of it, all belong to a more comprehensive
unity. Only in <em>this</em> aspect is it treated otherwise, despite that deeply-felt
relationship of plant destiny and human destiny which is an eternal theme of
all lyrical poetry, and despite that similarity of human history to that of any
other of the higher life-groups which is the refrain of endless beast-legends,
sagas and fables.</p>

<p class='c001'>But only bring analogy to bear on this aspect as on the rest, letting the
world of human Cultures intimately and unreservedly work upon the imagination
instead of forcing it into a ready-made scheme. Let the words youth,
growth, maturity, decay—hitherto, and to-day more than ever, used to express
subjective valuations and entirely personal preferences in sociology, ethics
and æsthetics—be taken at last as objective descriptions of organic states.
Set forth the Classical Culture as a self-contained phenomenon embodying and
expressing the Classical soul, put it beside the Egyptian, the Indian, the Babylonian,
the Chinese and the Western, and determine for each of these higher
individuals what is typical in their surgings and what is necessary in the riot
of incident. And then at last will unfold itself the picture of world-history
that is natural to us, men of the West, and to us alone.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>X</h3>

<p class='c018'>Our narrower task, then, is primarily to determine, from such a world-survey,
the state of West Europe and America as at the epoch of 1800-2000—to
establish the chronological position of this period in the ensemble of Western
culture-history, its significance as a chapter that is in one or other guise necessarily
found in the biography of every Culture, and the organic and symbolic
meaning of its political, artistic, intellectual and social expression-forms.</p>

<p class='c001'>Considered in the spirit of analogy, this period appears as chronologically
parallel—“contemporary” in our special sense—with the phase of Hellenism,
and its present culmination, marked by the World-War, corresponds
with the transition from the Hellenistic to the Roman age. <em>Rome</em>, with its
rigorous realism—uninspired, barbaric, disciplined, practical, Protestant,
<em>Prussian</em>—will always give us, working as we must by analogies, the key to
understanding our own future. The <i>break of destiny that we express by hyphening
the words “Greeks = Romans” is occurring <a id='corr26.39'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='fur'>for</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_26.39'>for</a></span> us also, separating that which is
already fulfilled from that which is to come</i>. Long ago we might and should have
seen in the “Classical” world a development which is the complete counterpart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>of our own Western development, differing indeed from it in every detail
of the surface but entirely similar as regards the inward power driving the
great organism towards its end. We might have found the constant <span lang="la"><i>alter ego</i></span>
of our own actuality in establishing the correspondence, item by item, from
the “Trojan War” and the Crusades, Homer and the Nibelungenlied, through
Doric and Gothic, Dionysian movement and Renaissance, Polycletus and John
Sebastian Bach, Athens and Paris, Aristotle and Kant, Alexander and Napoleon,
to the world-city and the imperialism common to both Cultures.</p>

<p class='c001'>Unfortunately, this requires an interpretation of the picture of Classical history
very different from the incredibly one-sided, superficial, prejudiced, limited
picture that we have in fact given to it. We have, in truth been only too conscious
of our near relation to the Classical Age, and only too prone in consequence
to unconsidered assertion of it. Superficial similarity is a great snare,
and our entire Classical study fell a victim to it as soon as it passed from the
(admittedly masterly) ordering and critique of the discoveries to the interpretation
of their spiritual meaning. That close inward relation in which we
conceive ourselves to stand towards the Classical, and which leads us to think
that we are its pupils and successors (whereas in reality we are simply its
adorers), is a venerable prejudice which ought at last to be put aside. The
whole religious-philosophical, art-historical and social-critical work of the
19th Century has been necessary to enable us, not to <em>understand</em> Æschylus, Plato,
Apollo and Dionysus, the Athenian state and Cæsarism (which we are far indeed
from doing), but to begin to realize, once and for all, how immeasurably alien
and distant these things are from our inner selves—more alien, maybe, than
Mexican gods and Indian architecture.</p>

<p class='c001'>Our views of the Græco-Roman Culture have always swung between two
extremes, and our standpoints have invariably been defined for us by the
“ancient-mediæval-modern” scheme. One group, public men before all else—economists,
politicians, jurists—opine that “present-day mankind” is
making excellent progress, assess it and its performances at the very highest
value and measure everything earlier by its standards. There is no modern
party that has not weighed up Cleon, Marius, Themistocles, Catiline, the
Gracchi, according to its own principles. On the other hand we have the
group of artists, poets, philologists and philosophers. These feel themselves
to be out of their element in the aforesaid present, and in consequence choose
for themselves in this or that past epoch a standpoint that is in its way just
as absolute and dogmatic from which to condemn “to-day.” The one group
looks upon Greece as a “not yet,” the other upon modernity as a “nevermore.”
Both labour under the obsession of a scheme of history which treats the two
epochs as part of the same straight line.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this opposition it is the two souls of Faust that express themselves. The
danger of the one group lies in a clever superficiality. In its hands there remains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>finally, of all Classical Culture, of all reflections of the Classical soul, nothing
but a bundle of social, economic, political and physiological facts, and the rest
is treated as “secondary results,” “reflexes,” “attendant phenomena.” In the
books of this group we find not a hint of the mythical force of Æschylus’s
choruses, of the immense mother-earth struggle of the early sculpture, the
Doric column, of the richness of the Apollo-cult, of the real depth of the Roman
Emperor-worship. The other group, composed above all of belated romanticists—represented
in recent times by the three Basel professors Bachofen,
Burckhardt and Nietzsche—succumb to the usual dangers of ideology. They
lose themselves in the clouds of an antiquity that is really no more than the
image of their own sensibility in a philological mirror. They rest their case
upon the only evidence which they consider worthy to support it, viz., the
relics of the old literature, yet there never was a Culture so incompletely represented
for us by its great writers.<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c019'><sup>[20]</sup></a> The first group, on the other hand, supports
itself principally upon the humdrum material of law-sources, inscriptions and
coins (which Burckhardt and Nietzsche, very much to their own loss, despised)
and subordinates thereto, often with little or no sense of truth and fact, the
surviving literature. Consequently, even in point of critical foundations,
neither group takes the other seriously. I have never heard that Nietzsche and
Mommsen had the smallest respect for each other.</p>

<p class='c001'>But neither group has attained to that higher method of treatment which
reduces this opposition of criteria to ashes, although it was within their power
to do so. In their self-limitation they paid the penalty for taking over the
causality-principle from natural science. Unconsciously they arrived at a pragmatism
that sketchily copied the world-picture drawn by physics and, instead
of revealing, obscured and confused the quite other-natured forms of history.
They had no better expedient for subjecting the mass of historical material to
critical and normative examination than to consider one complex of phenomena
as being primary and causative and the rest as being secondary, as being consequences
or effects. And it was not only the matter-of-fact school that resorted
to this method. The romanticists did likewise, for History had not
revealed even to their dreaming gaze its specific logic; and yet they <em>felt</em> that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>there was an immanent necessity in it to determine this somehow, rather than
turn their backs upon History in despair like Schopenhauer.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>XI</h3>

<p class='c018'>Briefly, then, there are two ways of regarding the Classical—the materialistic
and the ideological. By the former, it is asserted that the sinking of one
scale-pan has its cause in the rising of the other, and it is shown that this
occurs invariably (truly a striking theorem); and in this juxtaposing of cause
and effect we naturally find the social and sexual, at all events the purely political,
facts classed as causes and the religious, intellectual and (so far as the
materialist tolerates them as facts at all) the artistic as effects. On the other
hand, the ideologues show that the rising of one scale-pan follows from the
sinking of the other, which they are able to prove of course with equal exactitude;
this done, they lose themselves in cults, mysteries, customs, in the secrets
of the strophe and the line, throwing scarcely a side-glance at the commonplace
daily life—for them an unpleasant consequence of earthly imperfection. Each
side, with its gaze fixed on causality, demonstrates that the other side either
cannot or will not understand the true linkages of things and each ends by
calling the other blind, superficial, stupid, absurd or frivolous, oddities or
Philistines. It shocks the ideologue if anyone deals with Hellenic finance-problems
and instead of, for example, telling us the deep meanings of the
Delphic oracle, describes the far-reaching money operations which the Oracle
priests undertook with their accumulated treasures. The politician, on the
other hand, has a superior smile for those who waste their enthusiasm on ritual
formulæ and the dress of Attic youths, instead of writing a book adorned with
up-to-date catchwords about antique class-struggles.</p>

<p class='c001'>The one type is foreshadowed from the very outset in Petrarch; it created
Florence and Weimar and the Western classicism. The other type appears in
the middle of the 18th Century, along with the rise of civilized,<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c019'><sup>[21]</sup></a> economic-megalopolitan<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c019'><sup>[22]</sup></a>
politics, and England is therefore its birthplace (Grote). At
bottom, the opposition is between the conceptions of culture-man and those
of civilization-man, and it is too deep, too essentially human, to allow the
weaknesses of <em>both standpoints alike</em> to be seen or overcome.</p>

<p class='c001'>The materialist himself is on this point an idealist. He too, without wishing
or desiring it, has made his views dependent upon his wishes. In fact all
our finest minds without exception have bowed down reverently before the
picture of the Classical, abdicating in this one instance alone their function of
unrestricted criticism. The freedom and power of Classical research are always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>hindered, and its data obscured, by a certain almost religious awe. In all history
there is no analogous case of one Culture making a passionate cult of the
memory of another. Our devotion is evidenced yet again in the fact that since
the Renaissance, a thousand years of history have been undervalued so that an
ideal “Middle” Age may serve as a link between ourselves and antiquity. We
Westerners have sacrificed on the Classical altar the purity and independence of
our art, for we have not dared to create without a side-glance at the “sublime
exemplar.” We have projected our own deepest spiritual needs and feelings
on to the Classical picture. Some day a gifted psychologist will deal with
this most fateful illusion and tell us the story of the “Classical” that we have
so consistently reverenced since the days of Gothic. Few theses would be more
helpful for the understanding of the Western soul from Otto III, the first victim
of the South, to Nietzsche, the last.</p>

<p class='c001'>Goethe on his Italian tour speaks with enthusiasm of the buildings of
Palladio, whose frigid and academic work we to-day regard very sceptically:
but when he goes on to Pompeii he does not conceal his dissatisfaction in
experiencing “a strange, half-unpleasant impression,” and what he has to say
on the temples of Pæstum and Segesta—masterpieces of Hellenic art—is
embarrassed and trivial. Palpably, when Classical antiquity in its full force
met him face to face, he did not recognize it. It is the same with all others.
Much that was Classical they chose not to see, and so they saved their inward
image of the Classical—which was in reality the background of a life-ideal
that they themselves had created and nourished with their heart’s blood, a
vessel filled with their own world-feeling, a phantom, an idol. The audacious
descriptions of Aristophanes, Juvenal or Petronius of life in the Classical cities—the
southern dirt and riff-raff, terrors and brutalities, pleasure-boys and
Phrynes, phallus worship and imperial orgies—excite the enthusiasm of the
student and the dilettante, who find the same realities in the world-cities of
to-day too lamentable and repulsive to face. “In the cities life is bad; there
are too many of the lustful.”—<span lang="de"><i>also sprach Zarathustra</i></span>. They commend the
state-sense of the Romans, but despise the man of to-day who permits himself
any contact with public affairs. There is a type of scholar whose clarity of
vision comes under some irresistible spell when it turns from a frock-coat to a
toga, from a British football-ground to a Byzantine circus, from a transcontinental
railway to a Roman road in the Alps, from a thirty-knot destroyer to
a trireme, from Prussian bayonets to Roman spears—nowadays, even, from a
modern engineer’s Suez Canal to that of a Pharaoh. He would admit a steam-engine
as a symbol of human passion and an expression of intellectual force if
it were Hero of Alexandria who invented it, not otherwise. To such it seems
blasphemous to talk of Roman central-heating or book-keeping in preference
to the worship of the Great Mother of the Gods.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the other school sees <em>nothing but</em> these things. It thinks it exhausts the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>essence of this Culture, alien as it is to ours, by treating the Greeks as simply
equivalent, and it obtains its conclusions by means of simple factual substitutions,
ignoring altogether the Classical <em>soul</em>. That there is not the slightest
inward correlation between the things meant by “Republic,” “freedom,”
“property” and the like then and there and the things meant by such words
here and now, it has no notion whatever. It makes fun of the historians of
the age of Goethe, who honestly expressed their own political ideals in classical
history forms and revealed their own personal enthusiasms in vindications or
condemnations of lay-figures named Lycurgus, Brutus, Cato, Cicero, Augustus—but
it cannot itself write a chapter without reflecting the party opinion of
its morning paper.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is, however, much the same whether the past is treated in the spirit of
Don Quixote or in that of Sancho Panza. Neither way leads to the end. In
sum, each school permits itself to bring into high relief that part of the
Classical which best expresses its own views—Nietzsche the pre-Socratic
Athens, the economists the Hellenistic period, the politicians Republican Rome,
poets the Imperial Age.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not that religious and artistic phenomena are more primitive than social
and economic, any more than the reverse. For the man who in these things
has won his unconditional freedom of outlook, beyond <em>all</em> personal interests
whatsoever, there is no dependence, no priority, no relation of cause and effect,
no differentiation of value or importance. That which assigns relative ranks
amongst the individual detail-facts is simply the greater or less purity and force
of their form-language, their symbolism, beyond all questions of good and evil,
high and low, useful and ideal.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>XII</h3>

<p class='c018'>Looked at in this way, the “Decline of the West” comprises nothing less
than the problem of <em>Civilization</em>. We have before us one of the fundamental
questions of all higher history. What is Civilization, understood as the organic-logical
sequel, fulfilment and finale of a culture?</p>

<p class='c001'>For every Culture has <em>its own</em> Civilization. In this work, for the first time
the two words, hitherto used to express an indefinite, more or less ethical,
distinction, are used in a <em>periodic</em> sense, to express a strict and necessary <em>organic
succession</em>. The Civilization is the inevitable <em>destiny</em> of the Culture, and in this
principle we obtain the viewpoint from which the deepest and gravest problems
of historical morphology become capable of solution. Civilizations are the
most external and artificial states of which a species of developed humanity is
capable. They are a conclusion, the thing-become succeeding the thing-becoming,
death following life, rigidity following expansion, intellectual age
and the stone-built, petrifying world-city following mother-earth and the
spiritual childhood of Doric and Gothic. They are an end, irrevocable, yet
by inward necessity reached again and again.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>So, for the first time, we are enabled to understand the Romans as the
<em>successors</em> of the Greeks, and light is projected into the deepest secrets of the
late-Classical period. What, but this, can be the meaning of the fact—which
can only be disputed by vain phrases—that the Romans were barbarians who
did not <em>precede</em> but <em>closed</em> a great development? Unspiritual, unphilosophical,
devoid of art, clannish to the point of brutality, aiming relentlessly at tangible
successes, they stand between the Hellenic Culture and nothingness. An imagination
directed purely to practical objects—they had religious laws governing
godward relations as they had other laws governing human relations,
but there was no specifically Roman saga of gods—was something which is
not found at all in Athens. In a word, Greek <em>soul</em>—Roman <em>intellect</em>; and this
antithesis is the differentia between Culture and Civilization. Nor is it only to
the Classical that it applies. Again and again there appears this type of strong-minded,
completely non-metaphysical man, and in the hands of this type lies
the intellectual and material destiny of each and every “late” period. Such
are the men who carried through the Babylonian, the Egyptian, the Indian, the
Chinese, the Roman Civilizations, and in such periods do Buddhism, Stoicism,
Socialism ripen into definitive world-conceptions which enable a moribund
humanity to be attacked and re-formed in its intimate structure. <em>Pure</em> Civilization,
as a historical process, consists in a progressive <em>taking-down</em> of forms that
have become inorganic or dead.</p>

<p class='c001'>The transition from Culture to Civilization was accomplished for the
Classical world in the 4th, for the Western in the 19th Century. From these
periods onward the great intellectual decisions take place, not as in the days of
the Orpheus-movement or the Reformation in the “whole world” where not
a hamlet is too small to be unimportant, but in three or four world-cities that
have absorbed into themselves the whole content of History, while the old
wide landscape of the Culture, become merely provincial, serves only to feed
the cities with what remains of its higher mankind.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>World-city and province</em><a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c019'><sup>[23]</sup></a>—the two basic ideas of every civilization—bring
up a wholly new form-problem of History, the very problem that we are living
through to-day with hardly the remotest conception of its immensity. In place
of a world, there is a <em>city, a point</em>, in which the whole life of broad regions is
collecting while the rest dries up. In place of a type-true people, born of and
grown on the soil, there is a new sort of nomad, cohering unstably in fluid
masses, the parasitical city dweller, traditionless, utterly matter-of-fact, religionless,
clever, unfruitful, deeply contemptuous of the countryman and especially
that highest form of countryman, the country gentleman. This is a
very great stride towards the inorganic, towards the end—what does it signify?
France and England have already taken the step and Germany is beginning to
do so. After Syracuse, Athens, and Alexandria comes Rome. After Madrid,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Paris, London come Berlin and New York. It is the destiny of whole regions
that lie outside the radiation-circle of one of these cities—of old Crete and
Macedon and to-day the Scandinavian North<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c019'><sup>[24]</sup></a>—to become “provinces.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Of old, the field on which the opposed conception of an epoch came to
battle was some world-problem of a metaphysical, religious or dogmatic kind,
and the battle was between the soil-genius of the countryman (noble, priest)
and the “worldly” patrician genius of the famous old small towns of Doric or
Gothic springtime. Of such a character were the conflicts over the Dionysus
religion—as in the tyranny of Kleisthenes of Sikyon<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c019'><sup>[25]</sup></a>—and those of the
Reformation in the German free cities and the Huguenot wars. But just as
these cities overcame the country-side (already it is a purely civic world-outlook
that appears in even Parmenides and Descartes), so in turn the world-city overcame
them. It is the common intellectual process of later periods such as the
Ionic and the Baroque, and to-day—as in the Hellenistic age which at its
outset saw the foundation of artificial, land-alien Alexandria—Culture-cities
like Florence, Nürnberg, Salamanca, Bruges and Prag, have become provincial
towns and fight inwardly a lost battle against the world-cities. The world-city
means cosmopolitanism in place of “home,”<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c019'><sup>[26]</sup></a> cold matter-of-fact in place
of reverence for tradition and age, scientific irreligion as a fossil representative
of the older religion of the heart, “society” in place of the state, natural instead
of hard-earned rights. It was in the conception of <em>money</em> as an inorganic and
abstract magnitude, entirely disconnected from the notion of the fruitful earth
and the primitive values, that the Romans had the advantage of the Greeks.
Thenceforward any high ideal of life becomes largely a question of money.
Unlike the Greek stoicism of Chrysippus, the Roman stoicism of Cato and
Seneca presupposes a private income;<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c019'><sup>[27]</sup></a> and, unlike that of the 18th Century,
the social-ethical sentiment of the 20th, if it is to be realized at a higher level
than that of professional (and lucrative) agitation, is a matter for millionaires.
To the world-city belongs not a folk but a mass. Its uncomprehending hostility
to all the traditions representative of the Culture (nobility, church, privileges,
dynasties, convention in art and limits of knowledge in science), the keen and
cold intelligence that confounds the wisdom of the peasant, the new-fashioned
naturalism that in relation to all matters of sex and society goes back far beyond
Rousseau and Socrates to quite primitive instincts and conditions, the reappearance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>of the <span lang="la"><i>panem et circenses</i></span> in the form of wage-disputes and football-grounds—all
these things betoken the definite closing-down of the Culture and the
opening of a quite new phase of human existence—anti-provincial, late,
futureless, but quite inevitable.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is what has to be <em>viewed</em>, and viewed not with the eyes of the partisan,
the ideologue, the up-to-date novelist, not from this or that “standpoint,” but
in a high, time-free perspective embracing whole millenniums of historical
world-forms, if we are really to comprehend the great crisis of the present.</p>

<p class='c001'>To me it is a symbol of the first importance that in the Rome of Crassus—triumvir
and all-powerful building-site speculator—the Roman people with
its proud inscriptions, the people before whom Gauls, Greeks, Parthians, Syrians
afar trembled, lived in appalling misery in the many-storied lodging-houses
of dark suburbs,<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c019'><sup>[28]</sup></a> accepting with indifference or even with a sort of sporting
interest the consequences of the military expansion: that many famous old-noble
families, descendants of the men who defeated the Celts and the Samnites, lost
their ancestral homes through standing apart from the wild rush of speculation
and were reduced to renting wretched apartments; that, while along the Appian
Way there arose the splendid and still wonderful tombs of the financial magnates,
the corpses of the people were thrown along with animal carcases and
town refuse into a monstrous common grave—till in Augustus’s time it was
banked over for the avoidance of pestilence and so became the site of Mæcenas’s
renowned park; that in depopulated Athens, which lived on visitors and on the
bounty of rich foreigners, the mob of parvenu tourists from Rome gaped at the
works of the Periclean age with as little understanding as the American globe-trotter
in the Sistine Chapel at those of Michelangelo, every removable art-piece
having ere this been taken away or bought at fancy prices to be replaced
by the Roman buildings which grew up, colossal and arrogant, by the side of
the low and modest structures of the old time. In such things—which it is
the historian’s business not to praise or to blame but to consider morphologically—there
lies, plain and immediate enough for one who has learnt to see,
an <em>idea</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>For it will become manifest that, from this moment on, all great conflicts
of world-outlook, of politics, of art, of science, of feeling will be under the
influence of this one opposition. What is the hall-mark of a politic of Civilization
to-day, in contrast to a politic of Culture yesterday? It is, for the Classical
rhetoric, and for the Western journalism, both serving that abstract which
represents the power of Civilization—<em>money</em>.<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c019'><sup>[29]</sup></a> It is the money-spirit which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>penetrates unremarked the historical forms of the people’s existence, often without
destroying or even in the least disturbing these forms—the form of the
Roman state, for instance, underwent very much less alteration between the
elder Scipio and Augustus than is usually imagined. Though forms subsist, the
great political parties nevertheless cease to be more than reputed centres of
decision. The decisions in fact lie elsewhere. A small number of superior heads,
whose names are very likely not the best-known, settle everything, while
below them are the great mass of second-rate politicians—rhetors, tribunes,
deputies, journalists—selected through a provincially-conceived franchise to
keep alive the illusion of popular self-determination. And art? Philosophy?
The ideals of a Platonic or those of a Kantian age had for the higher mankind
concerned a general validity. But those of a Hellenistic age, or those of our
own, are valid exclusively for the brain of the Megalopolitan. For the villager’s
or, generally, the nature-man’s world-feeling our Socialism—like its near relation
Darwinism (how utterly un-Goethian are the formulæ of “struggle for
existence” and “natural selection”!), like its other relative the woman-and-marriage
problem of Ibsen, Strindberg, and Shaw, like the impressionistic
tendencies of anarchic sensuousness and the whole bundle of modern longings,
temptations and pains expressed in Baudelaire’s verse and Wagner’s music—are
simply non-existent. The smaller the town, the more unmeaning it becomes
to busy oneself with painting or with music of these kinds. To the Culture
belong gymnastics, the tournament, the agon, and to the Civilization belongs
Sport. This is the true distinction between the Hellenic palæstra and the
Roman circus.<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c019'><sup>[30]</sup></a> Art itself becomes a sport (hence the phrase “art for art’s
sake”) to be played before a highly-intelligent audience of connoisseurs and
buyers, whether the feat consist in mastering absurd instrumental tone-masses
and taking harmonic fences, or in some <span lang="fr"><i>tour de force</i></span> of colouring. Then a new
fact-philosophy appears, which can only spare a smile for metaphysical speculation,
and a new literature that is a necessity of life for the megalopolitan palate
and nerves and both unintelligible and ugly to the provincials. Neither Alexandrine
poetry nor <span lang="fr"><i>plein-air</i></span> painting is anything to the “people.” And, then
as now, the phase of transition is marked by a series of scandals only to be found
at such moments. The anger evoked in the Athenian populace by Euripides and
by the “Revolutionary” painting of Apollodorus, for example, is repeated in
the opposition to Wagner, Manet, Ibsen, and Nietzsche.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is possible to understand the Greeks without mentioning their economic
relations; the Romans, on the other hand, can <em>only</em> be understood through these.
Chæronea and Leipzig were the last battles fought about an idea. In the First
Punic War and in 1870 economic motives are no longer to be overlooked. Not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>till the Romans came with their practical energy was slave-holding given that
big collective character which many students regard as the die-stamp of Classical
economics, legislation and way of life, and which in any event vastly
lowered both the value and the inner worthiness of such free labour as continued
to exist side by side with gang-labour. And it was not the Latin, but the
Germanic peoples of the West and America who developed out of the steam-engine
a big industry that transformed the face of the land. The relation of
these phenomena to Stoicism and to Socialism is unmistakable. Not till the
Roman Cæsarism—foreshadowed by C. Flaminius, shaped first by Marius,
handled by strong-minded, large-scale men of fact—did the Classical World
learn the <em>pre-eminence of money</em>. Without this fact neither Cæsar, nor “Rome”
generally, is understandable. In every Greek is a Don Quixote, in every Roman
a Sancho Panza factor, and these factors are dominants.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>XIII</h3>

<p class='c018'>Considered in itself, the Roman world-dominion was a negative phenomenon,
being the result not of a surplus of energy on the one side—that the
Romans had never had since Zama—but of a deficiency of resistance on the
other. That the Romans did <em>not</em> conquer the world is certain;<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c019'><sup>[31]</sup></a> they merely
took possession of a booty that lay open to everyone. The <span lang="la"><i>Imperium Romanum</i></span>
came into existence not as the result of such an extremity of military and
financial effort as had characterized the Punic Wars, but because the old East
forwent all external self-determinations. We must not be deluded by the appearance
of brilliant military successes. With a few ill-trained, ill-led, and
sullen legions, Lucullus and Pompey conquered whole realms—a phenomenon
that in the period of the battle of Ipsus would have been unthinkable. The
Mithradatic danger, serious enough for a system of material force which had
never been put to any real test, would have been nothing to the conquerors of
Hannibal. After Zama, the Romans never again either waged or were capable
of waging a war against a great military Power.<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c019'><sup>[32]</sup></a> Their classic wars were those
against the Samnites, Pyrrhus and Carthage. Their grand hour was Cannæ.
To maintain the heroic posture for centuries on end is beyond the power of any
people. The Prussian-German people have had three great moments (1813, 1870
and 1914), and that is more than others have had.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here, then, I lay it down that <em>Imperialism</em>, of which petrifacts such as the
Egyptian empire, the Roman, the Chinese, the Indian may continue to exist
for hundreds or thousands of years—dead bodies, amorphous and dispirited
masses of men, scrap-material from a great history—is to be taken as the
typical symbol of the passing away. Imperialism is Civilization unadulterated.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>In this phenomenal form the destiny of the West is now irrevocably set. The
energy of culture-man is directed inwards, that of civilization-man outwards.
And thus I see in Cecil Rhodes the first man of a new age. He stands for the
political style of a far-ranging, Western, Teutonic and especially German future,
and his phrase “expansion is everything” is the Napoleonic reassertion of the
indwelling tendency of <em>every</em> Civilization that has fully ripened—Roman, Arab
or Chinese. It is not a matter of choice—it is not the conscious will of individuals,
or even that of whole classes or peoples that decides. The expansive
tendency is a doom, something daemonic and immense, which grips, forces into
service, and uses up the late mankind of the world-city stage, willy-nilly, aware
or unaware.<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c019'><sup>[33]</sup></a> Life is the process of effecting possibilities, and for the brain-man
there are <em>only extensive</em> possibilities.<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c019'><sup>[34]</sup></a> Hard as the half-developed Socialism
of to-day is fighting against expansion, one day it will become arch-expansionist
with all the vehemence of destiny. Here the form-language of politics, as the
direct intellectual expression of a certain type of humanity, touches on a deep
metaphysical problem—on the fact, affirmed in the grant of unconditional
validity to the causality-principle, that <em>the soul is the complement of its extension</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>When, between 480 and 230,<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c019'><sup>[35]</sup></a> the Chinese group of states was tending
towards imperialism, it was entirely futile to combat the principle of Imperialism
(Lien-heng), practised in particular by the “Roman” state of Tsin<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c019'><sup>[36]</sup></a> and
<a id='corr37.20'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='theoritically'>theoretically</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_37.20'>theoretically</a></span> represented by the philosopher Dschang Yi, by ideas of a League
of Nations (Hoh-tsung) largely derived from Wang Hü, a profound sceptic who
had no illusions as to the men or the political possibilities of this “late”
period. Both sides opposed the anti-political idealism of Lao-tse, but as between
themselves it was Lien-heng and not Hoh-tsung which swam with the
natural current of expansive Civilization.<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c019'><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Rhodes is to be regarded as the first precursor of a Western type of Cæsars,
whose day is to come though yet distant. He stands midway between Napoleon
and the force-men of the next centuries, just as Flaminius, who from 232 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>
onward pressed the Romans to undertake the subjugation of Cisalpine Gaul
and so initiated the policy of colonial expansion, stands between Alexander and
Cæsar. Strictly speaking, Flaminius was a private person—for his real power
was of a kind not embodied in any constitutional office—who exercised a
dominant influence in the state at a time when the state-idea was giving way to
the pressure of economic factors. So far as Rome is concerned, he was the archetype
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>of opposition Cæsarism; with him there came to an end the <em>idea of state-service</em>
and there began the “will to power” which ignored traditions and
reckoned only with forces. Alexander and Napoleon were romantics; though
they stood on the threshold of Civilization and in its cold clear air, the one
fancied himself an Achilles and the other read Werther. Cæsar, on the contrary,
was a pure man of fact gifted with immense understanding.</p>

<p class='c001'>But even for Rhodes political success means territorial and financial success,
and only that. Of this Roman-ness within himself he was fully aware. But
Western Civilization has not yet taken shape in such strength and purity as
this. It was only before his maps that he could fall into a sort of poetic trance,
this son of the parsonage who, sent out to South Africa without means, made a
gigantic fortune and employed it as the engine of political aims. His idea of
a trans-African railway from the Cape to Cairo, his project of a South African
empire, his intellectual hold on the hard metal souls of the mining magnates
whose wealth he forced into the service of his schemes, his capital Bulawayo,
royally planned as a future Residence by a statesman who was all-powerful yet
stood in no definite relation to the State, his wars, his diplomatic deals, his
road-systems, his syndicates, his armies, his conception of the “great duty to
civilization” of the man of brain—all this, broad and imposing, is the prelude
of a future which is still in store for us and with which the history of
West-European mankind will be definitely <em>closed</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>He who does not understand that this outcome is obligatory and insusceptible
of modification, that our choice is between willing <em>this</em> and willing nothing
at all, between cleaving to <em>this</em> destiny or despairing of the future and of life
itself; he who cannot feel that there is grandeur also in the realizations of
powerful intelligences, in the energy and discipline of metal-hard natures, in
battles fought with the coldest and most abstract means; he who is obsessed
with the idealism of a provincial and would pursue the ways of life of past
ages—must forgo all desire to comprehend history, to live through history or
to make history.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus regarded, the Imperium Romanum appears no longer as an isolated
phenomenon, but as the normal product of a strict and energetic, megalopolitan,
predominantly practical spirituality, as typical of a final and irreversible condition
which has occurred often enough though it has only been identified
as such in this instance.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let it be realized, then:</p>

<p class='c001'>That the secret of historical form does not lie on the surface, that it cannot
be grasped by means of similarities of costume and setting, and that in the
history of men as in that of animals and plants there occur phenomena showing
deceptive similarity but inwardly without any connexion—e.g., Charlemagne
and Haroun-al-Raschid, Alexander and Cæsar, the German wars upon Rome
and the Mongol onslaughts upon West Europe—and other phenomena of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>extreme outward dissimilarity but of identical import—e.g., Trajan and
Rameses II, the Bourbons and the Attic Demos, Mohammed and Pythagoras.</p>

<p class='c001'>That the 19th and 20th centuries, hitherto looked on as the highest point
of an ascending straight line of world-history, are in reality a stage of life
which may be observed in every Culture that has ripened to its limit—a stage
of life characterized not by Socialists, Impressionists, electric railways, torpedoes
and differential equations (for these are only body-constituents of the
time), but by a civilized spirituality which possesses not only these but also
quite other creative possibilities.</p>

<p class='c001'>That, as our own time represents a transitional phase which occurs with
certainty under particular conditions, there are perfectly well-defined states
(such as have occurred more than once in the history of the past) <em>later</em> than the
present-day state of West Europe, and therefore that</p>

<p class='c001'>The future of the West is not a limitless tending upwards and onwards for
all time towards our present ideals, but a single phenomenon of history, strictly
limited and defined as to form and duration, which covers a few centuries and
can be viewed and, in essentials, calculated from available precedents.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>XIV</h3>

<p class='c018'>This high plane of contemplation once attained, the rest is easy. To this
<em>single</em> idea one can refer, and by it one can solve, without straining or forcing,
all those separate problems of religion, art-history, epistemology, ethics, politics,
economics with which the modern intellect has so passionately—and so
vainly—busied itself for decades.</p>

<p class='c001'>This idea is one of those truths that have only to be expressed with full
clarity to become indisputable. It is one of the inward necessities of the Western
Culture and of its world-feeling. It is capable of entirely transforming the
world-outlook of one who fully understands it, i.e., makes it intimately his
own. It immensely deepens the world-picture natural and necessary to us in
that, already trained to regard world-historical evolution as an organic unit
seen backwards from our standpoint in the present, we are enabled by its aid
to follow the broad lines into the future—a privilege of dream-calculation
till now permitted only to the physicist. It is, I repeat, in effect the substitution
of a Copernican for a Ptolemaic aspect of history, that is, an immeasurable
widening of horizon.</p>

<p class='c001'>Up to now everyone has been at liberty to hope what he pleased about the
future. Where there are no facts, sentiment rules. But henceforward it will
be every man’s business to inform himself of what <em>can</em> happen and therefore of
what with the unalterable necessity of destiny and irrespective of personal
ideals, hopes or desires, <em>will</em> happen. When we use the risky word “freedom”
we shall mean freedom to do, not this or that, but the necessary or nothing.
The feeling that this is “just as it should be” is the hall-mark of the man of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>fact. To lament it and blame it is not to alter it. To birth belongs death, to
youth age, to life generally its form and its allotted span. The present is a
civilized, emphatically not a cultured time, and <span lang="la"><i>ipso facto</i></span> a great number of
life-capacities fall out as impossible. This may be deplorable, and may be and
will be deplored in pessimist philosophy and poetry, but it is not in our power
to make otherwise. It will not be—already it is not—permissible to defy
clear historical experience and to expect, merely because we hope, that this
will spring or that will flourish.</p>

<p class='c001'>It will no doubt be objected that such a world-outlook, which in giving
this certainty as to the outlines and tendency of the future cuts off all far-reaching
hopes, would be unhealthy for all and fatal for many, once it ceased
to be a mere theory and was adopted as a practical scheme of life by the group
of personalities effectively moulding the future.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such is not my opinion. We are civilized, not Gothic or Rococo, people;
we have to reckon with the hard cold facts of a <em>late</em> life, to which the parallel
is to be found not in Pericles’s Athens but in Cæsar’s Rome. Of great painting
or great music there can no longer be, for Western people, any question. Their
architectural possibilities have been exhausted these hundred years. Only <em>extensive</em>
possibilities are left to them. Yet, for a sound and vigorous generation
that is filled with unlimited hopes, I fail to see that it is any disadvantage to
discover betimes that some of these hopes must come to nothing. And if the
hopes thus doomed should be those most dear, well, a man who is worth anything
will not be dismayed. It is true that the issue may be a tragic one for
some individuals who in their decisive years are overpowered by the conviction
that in the spheres of architecture, drama, painting, there is nothing left for
<em>them</em> to conquer. What matter if they do go under! It has been the convention
hitherto to admit no limits of any sort in these matters, and to believe that
each period had its own task to do in each sphere. Tasks therefore were found
by hook or by crook, leaving it to be settled posthumously whether or not
the artist’s faith was justified and his life-work necessary. Now, nobody but
a pure romantic would take this way out. Such a pride is not the pride of a
Roman. What are we to think of the individual who, standing before an exhausted
quarry, would rather be told that a new vein will be struck to-morrow—the
bait offered by the radically false and mannerized art of the moment—than
be shown a rich and virgin clay-bed near by? The lesson, I think, would
be of benefit to the coming generations, as showing them what is possible—and
therefore necessary—and what is excluded from the inward potentialities
of their time. Hitherto an incredible total of intellect and power has been
squandered in false directions. The West-European, however historically he
may think and feel, is at a certain stage of life invariably uncertain of his own
direction; he gropes and feels his way and, if unlucky in environment, he loses
it. But now at last the work of centuries enables him to view the disposition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>of his own life in relation to the general culture-scheme and to test his own
powers and purposes. And I can only hope that men of the new generation
may be moved by this book to devote themselves to technics instead of lyrics,
the sea instead of the paint-brush, and politics instead of epistemology. Better
they could not do.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>XV</h3>

<p class='c018'>It still remains to consider the relation of a morphology of world-history
to Philosophy. All genuine historical work is philosophy, unless it is mere
ant-industry. But the operations of the systematic philosopher are subject to
constant and serious error through his assuming the permanence of his results.
He overlooks the fact that every thought lives in a historical world and is
therefore involved in the common destiny of mortality. He supposes that
higher thought possesses an everlasting and unalterable objectiveness (Gegenstand),
that the great questions of all epochs are identical, and that therefore
they are capable in the last analysis of unique answers.</p>

<p class='c001'>But question and answer are here one, and the great questions are made
great by the very fact that unequivocal answers to them are so passionately
demanded, so that it is as life-symbols only that they possess significance.
There are no eternal truths. Every philosophy is the expression of its own
and only its own time, and—if by philosophy we mean effective philosophy
and not academic triflings about judgment-forms, sense-categories and the like—no
two ages possess the same philosophic intentions. The difference is not
between perishable and imperishable doctrines but between doctrines which live
their day and doctrines which never live at all. The immortality of thoughts-become
is an illusion—the essential is, what kind of man comes to expression
in them. The greater the man, the truer the philosophy, with the inward
truth that in a great work of art transcends all proof of its several elements
or even of their compatibility with one another. At highest, the philosophy
may absorb the entire content of an epoch, realize it within itself and then,
embodying it in some grand form or personality, pass it on to be developed
further and further. The scientific dress or the mark of learning adopted by a
philosophy is here unimportant. Nothing is simpler than to make good poverty
of ideas by founding a system, and even a good idea has little value when
enunciated by a solemn ass. Only its necessity to life decides the eminence of
a doctrine.</p>

<p class='c001'>For me, therefore, the test of value to be applied to a thinker is his eye for
the great facts of his own time. Only this can settle whether he is merely a
clever architect of systems and principles, versed in definitions and analyses,
or whether it is the very soul of his time that speaks in his works and his intuitions.
A philosopher who cannot grasp and command actuality as well will
never be of the first rank. The Pre-Socratics were merchants and politicians
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span><span lang="fr"><i>en grand</i></span>. The desire to put his political ideas into practice in Syracuse
nearly cost Plato his life, and it was the same Plato who discovered the set
of geometrical theorems that enabled Euclid to build up the Classical system of
mathematics. Pascal—whom Nietzsche knows only as the “broken Christian”—Descartes,
Leibniz were the first mathematicians and technicians of
their time.</p>

<p class='c001'>The great “Pre-Socratics” of China from Kwan-tsi (about 670) to Confucius
(550-478) were statesmen, regents, lawgivers like Pythagoras and Parmenides,
like Hobbes and Leibniz. With Lao-tsze—the opponent of all state
authority and high politics and the enthusiast of small peaceful communities—unworldliness
and deed-shyness first appear, heralds of lecture-room and
study philosophy. But Lao-tsze was in his time, the <span lang="fr"><i>ancien régime</i></span> of China, an
exception in the midst of sturdy philosophers for whom epistemology meant
the knowledge of the important relations of actual life.</p>

<p class='c001'>And herein, I think, all the philosophers of the newest age are open to a
serious criticism. What they do not possess is real standing in actual life. Not
one of them has intervened effectively, either in higher politics, in the development
of modern technics, in matters of communication, in economics, or in
any other <em>big</em> actuality, with a single act or a single compelling idea. Not one
of them counts in mathematics, in physics, in the science of government, even
to the extent that Kant counted. Let us glance at other times. Confucius was
several times a minister. Pythagoras was the organizer of an important political
movement<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c019'><sup>[38]</sup></a> akin to the Cromwellian, the significance of which is even now
far underestimated by Classical researchers. Goethe, besides being a model
executive minister—though lacking, alas! the operative sphere of a great
state—was interested in the Suez and Panama canals (the dates of which he
foresaw with accuracy) and their effects on the economy of the world, and he
busied himself again and again with the question of American economic life
and its reactions on the Old World, and with that of the dawning era of
machine-industry. Hobbes was one of the originators of the great plan of
winning South America for England, and although in execution the plan went
no further than the occupation of Jamaica, he has the glory of being one of the
founders of the British Colonial Empire. Leibniz, without doubt the greatest
intellect in Western philosophy, the founder of the differential calculus and the
<span lang="la"><i>analysis situs</i></span>, conceived or co-operated in a number of major political schemes,
one of which was to relieve Germany by drawing the attention of Louis XIV
to the importance of Egypt as a factor in French world-policy. The ideas of
the memorandum on this subject that he drew up for the Grand Monarch were
so far in advance of their time (1672) that it has been thought that Napoleon
made use of them for his Eastern venture. Even thus early, Leibniz laid down
the principle that Napoleon grasped more and more clearly after Wagram, viz.,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>that acquisitions on the Rhine and in Belgium would not permanently better
the position of France and that the neck of Suez would one day be the key of
world-dominance. Doubtless the King was not equal to these deep political
and strategic conceptions of the Philosopher.</p>

<p class='c001'>Turning from men of this mould to the “philosophers” of to-day, one is dismayed
and shamed. How poor their personalities, how commonplace their
political and practical outlook! Why is it that the mere idea of calling upon
one of them to prove his intellectual eminence in government, diplomacy,
large-scale organization, or direction of any big colonial, commercial or transport
concern is enough to evoke our pity? And this insufficiency indicates, not
that they possess inwardness, but simply that they lack weight. I look round
in vain for an instance in which a modern “philosopher” has made a name by
even one deep or far-seeing pronouncement on an important question of the day.
I see nothing but provincial opinions of the same kind as anyone else’s. Whenever
I take up a work by a modern thinker, I find myself asking: has he any
idea whatever of the actualities of world-politics, world-city problems, capitalism,
the future of the state, the relation of technics to the course of civilization,
Russia, Science? Goethe would have understood all this and revelled in
it, but there is not one living philosopher capable of taking it in. This sense of
actualities is of course not the same thing as the content of a philosophy but, I
repeat, it is an infallible symptom of its inward necessity, its fruitfulness and
its symbolic importance.</p>

<p class='c001'>We must allow ourselves no illusions as to the gravity of this negative result.
It is palpable that we have lost sight of the final significance of effective philosophy.
We confuse philosophy with preaching, with agitation, with novel-writing,
with lecture-room jargon. We have descended from the perspective
of the bird to that of the frog. It has come to this, that the very <em>possibility</em> of a
real philosophy of to-day and to-morrow is in question. If not, it were far
better to become a colonist or an engineer, to do something, no matter what,
that is true and real, than to chew over once more the old dried-up themes under
cover of an alleged “new wave of philosophic thought”—far better to construct
an aero-engine than a new theory of apperception that is not wanted.
Truly it is a poor life’s work to restate once more, in slightly different terms,
views of a hundred predecessors on the Will or on psycho-physical parallelism.
This may be a profession, but a philosophy it emphatically is not. A doctrine
that does not attack and affect the life of the period in its inmost depths is no
doctrine and had better not be taught. And what was possible even yesterday
is, to-day, at least not indispensable.</p>

<p class='c001'>To me, the depths and refinement of mathematical and physical theories are
a joy; by comparison, the æsthete and the physiologist are fumblers. I would
sooner have the fine mind-begotten forms of a fast steamer, a steel structure, a
precision-lathe, the subtlety and elegance of many chemical and optical processes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>than all the pickings and stealings of present-day “arts and crafts,”
architecture and painting included. I prefer one Roman aqueduct to all Roman
temples and statues. I love the Colosseum and the giant vault of the Palatine,
for they display for me to-day in the brown massiveness of their brick construction
the <em>real</em> Rome and the grand practical sense of her engineers, but it is a
matter of indifference to me whether the empty and pretentious marblery of the
Cæsars—their rows of statuary, their friezes, their overloaded architraves—is
preserved or not. Glance at some reconstruction of the Imperial Fora—do
we not find them the true counterpart of a modern International Exhibition,
obtrusive, bulky, empty, a boasting in materials and dimensions wholly alien
to Periclean Greece and the Rococo alike, but exactly paralleled in the Egyptian
modernism that is displayed in the ruins of Rameses II (1300 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>) at Luxor and
Karnak? It was not for nothing that the genuine Roman despised the <span lang="la"><i>Græculus
histrio</i></span>, the kind of “artist” and the kind of “philosopher” to be found on the
soil of Roman Civilization. The time for art and philosophy had passed; they
were exhausted, used up, superfluous, and his instinct for the realities of life
told him so. <em>One</em> Roman law weighed more than all the lyrics and school-metaphysics
of the time together. And I maintain that to-day many an inventor,
many a diplomat, many a financier is a sounder philosopher than all
those who practise the dull craft of experimental psychology. This is a situation
which regularly repeats itself at a certain historical level. It would have
been absurd in a Roman of intellectual eminence, who might as Consul or
Prætor lead armies, organize provinces, build cities and roads, or even be the
Princeps in Rome, to want to hatch out some new variant of post-Platonic
school philosophy at Athens or Rhodes. Consequently no one did so. It was
not in harmony with the tendency of the age, and therefore it only attracted
third-class men of the kind that always advances as far as the <span lang="de"><i>Zeitgeist</i></span> of the
day before yesterday. It is a very grave question whether this stage has or has
not set in for us already.</p>

<p class='c001'>A century of purely extensive effectiveness, excluding big artistic and
metaphysical production—let us say frankly an irreligious time which coincides
exactly with the idea of the world-city—is a time of decline. True.
But we have not <em>chosen</em> this time. We cannot help it if we are born as men of
the early winter of full Civilization, instead of on the golden summit of a ripe
Culture, in a Phidias or a Mozart time. Everything depends on our seeing our
own position, our <em>destiny</em>, clearly, on our realizing that though we may lie to
ourselves about it we cannot evade it. He who does not acknowledge this in
his heart, ceases to be counted among the men of his generation, and remains
either a simpleton, a charlatan, or a pedant.</p>

<p class='c001'>Therefore, in approaching a problem of the present, one must begin by asking
one’s self—a question answered in advance by instinct in the case of the genuine
adept—what to-day is possible and what he must forbid himself. Only a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>few of the problems of metaphysics are, so to say, allocated for solution to any
epoch of thought. Even thus soon, a whole world separates Nietzsche’s time,
in which a last trace of romanticism was still operative, from our own, which
has shed every vestige of it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Systematic philosophy closes with the end of the 18th Century. Kant put
its utmost possibilities in forms both grand in themselves and—as a rule—final
for the Western soul. He is followed, as Plato and Aristotle were followed,
by a specifically megalopolitan philosophy that was not speculative but practical,
irreligious, social-ethical. This philosophy—paralleled in the Chinese
civilization by the schools of the “Epicurean” Yang-chu, the “Socialist”
Mo-ti, the “Pessimist” Chuang-tsü, the “Positivist” Mencius, and in the
Classical by the Cynics, the Cyrenaics, the Stoics and the Epicureans—begins
in the West with Schopenhauer, who is the first to make the <em>Will to life</em> (“creative
life-force”) the centre of gravity of his thought, although the deeper tendency
of his doctrine is obscured by his having, under the influence of a great
tradition, maintained the obsolete distinctions of phenomena and things-in-themselves
and suchlike. It is the same creative will-to-life that was Schopenhauer-wise
denied in “Tristan” and Darwin-wise asserted in “Siegfried”; that
was brilliantly and theatrically formulated by Nietzsche in “Zarathustra”;
that led the Hegelian Marx to an economic and the Malthusian Darwin to a
biological hypothesis which together have subtly transformed the world-outlook
of the Western megalopolis; and that produced a homogeneous series
of tragedy-conceptions extending from Hebbel’s “Judith” to Ibsen’s “Epilogue.”
It has embraced, therefore, all the possibilities of a true philosophy—and
at the same time it has exhausted them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Systematic philosophy, then, lies immensely far behind us, and ethical has
been wound up. <em>But a third possibility, corresponding to the Classical Scepticism,
still remains to the soul-world</em> of the present-day West, and it can be brought to
light by the hitherto unknown methods of historical morphology. That which
is a possibility is a necessity. The Classical scepticism is ahistoric, it doubts
by denying outright. But that of the West, if it is an inward necessity, a symbol
of the autumn of our spirituality, is obliged to be historical through and
through. Its solutions are got by treating everything as relative, as a historical
phenomenon, and its procedure is psychological. Whereas the Sceptic philosophy
arose within Hellenism as the negation of philosophy—declaring
philosophy to be purposeless—we, on the contrary, regard the <em>history of
philosophy</em> as, in the last resort, philosophy’s gravest theme. This <em>is</em> “skepsis,”
in the true sense, for whereas the Greek is led to renounce absolute standpoints
by contempt for the intellectual past, we are led to do so by comprehension of
that past as an organism.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this work it will be our task to sketch out this unphilosophical philosophy—the
last that West Europe will know. Scepticism is the expression of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>a pure Civilization; and it dissipates the world-picture of the Culture that has
gone before. For us, its success will lie in resolving all the older problems into
one, the genetic. The conviction that what <em>is</em> also <em>has become</em>, that the natural
and cognizable is rooted in the historic, that the World as the actual is founded
on an Ego as the potential actualized, that the “when” and the “how long”
hold as deep a secret as the “what,” leads directly to the fact that everything,
whatever else it may be, must at any rate be <em>the expression of something living</em>.
Cognitions and judgments too are acts of living men. The thinkers of the past
conceived external actuality as produced by cognition and motiving ethical
judgments, but to the thought of the future they are above all <em>expressions
and symbols. The Morphology of world-history becomes inevitably a universal
symbolism.</em></p>

<p class='c001'>With that, the claim of higher thought to possess general and eternal truths
falls to the ground. Truths are truths only in relation to a particular mankind.
Thus, my own philosophy is able to express and reflect <em>only</em> the Western (as
distinct from the Classical, Indian, or other) soul, and that soul <em>only</em> in its
present civilized phase by which its conception of the world, its practical range
and its sphere of effect are specified.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>XVI</h3>

<p class='c018'>In concluding this Introduction, I may be permitted to add a personal note.
In 1911, I proposed to myself to put together some broad considerations on the
political phenomena of the day and their possible developments. At that time
the World-War appeared to me both as imminent and also as the inevitable
outward manifestation of the historical crisis, and my endeavour was to comprehend
it from an examination of the spirit of the preceding centuries—not
years. In the course of this originally small task,<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c019'><sup>[39]</sup></a> the conviction forced itself
on me that for an effective understanding of the epoch the area to be taken into
the foundation-plan must be very greatly enlarged, and that in an investigation
of this sort, if the results were to be fundamentally conclusive and necessary
results, it was impossible to restrict one’s self to a single epoch and its political
actualities, or to confine one’s self to a pragmatical framework, or even to do
without purely metaphysical and highly transcendental methods of treatment.
It became evident that a political problem could not be comprehended by means
of politics themselves and that, frequently, important factors at work in the
depths could only be grasped through their artistic manifestations or even
distantly seen in the form of scientific or purely philosophical ideas. Even the
politico-social analysis of the last decades of the 19th century—a period of
tense quiet between two immense and outstanding events: the one which, expressed
in the Revolution and Napoleon, had fixed the picture of West-European
actuality for a century and another of at least equal significance that was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>visibly and ever more rapidly approaching—was found in the last resort to be
impossible without bringing in <em>all</em> the great problems of Being in all their
aspects. For, in the historical as in the natural world-picture, there is found
nothing, however small, that does not embody in itself the entire sum of
fundamental tendencies. And thus the original theme came to be immensely
widened. A vast number of unexpected (and in the main entirely novel) questions
and interrelations presented themselves. And finally it became perfectly
clear that no single fragment of history could be thoroughly illuminated unless
and until the secret of world-history itself, to wit the story of higher mankind
as an organism of regular structure, had been cleared up. And hitherto this has
not been done, even in the least degree.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this moment on, relations and connexions—previously often suspected,
sometimes touched on but never comprehended—presented themselves in ever-increasing
volume. The forms of the arts linked themselves to the forms of war
and state-policy. Deep relations were revealed between political and mathematical
aspects of the same Culture, between religious and technical conceptions,
between mathematics, music and sculpture, between economics and
cognition-forms. Clearly and unmistakably there appeared the fundamental
dependence of the most modern physical and chemical theories on the mythological
concepts of our Germanic ancestors, the style-congruence of tragedy
and power-technics and up-to-date finance, and the fact (bizarre at first but soon
self-evident) that oil-painting perspective, printing, the credit system, longrange
weapons, and contrapuntal music in one case, and the nude statue, the
city-state and coin-currency (discovered by the Greeks) in another were identical
expressions of one and the same spiritual principle. And, beyond and above
all, there stood out the fact that these great <em>groups of morphological relations</em>, each
one of which symbolically represents a particular sort of mankind in the whole
picture of world-history, are strictly symmetrical in structure. It is this
perspective that first opens out for us the true style of history. Belonging
itself as symbol and expression to one time and therefore inwardly possible
and necessary only for present-day Western man, it can but be compared—distantly—to
certain ideas of ultra-modern mathematics in the domain of
the Theory of Groups. These were thoughts that had occupied me for many
years, though dark and undefined until enabled by this method to emerge in
tangible form.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thereafter I saw the present—the approaching World-War—in a quite
other light. It was no longer a momentary constellation of casual facts due to
national sentiments, personal influences, or economic tendencies endowed with
an appearance of unity and necessity by some historian’s scheme of political or
social cause-and-effect, but the type of <em>a historical change of phase</em> occurring
within a great historical organism of definable compass at the point preordained
for it hundreds of years ago. The mark of the great crisis is its innumerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>passionate questionings and probings. In our own case there were books
and ideas by the thousand; but, scattered, disconnected, limited by the horizons
of specialisms as they were, they incited, depressed and confounded but could
not free. Hence, though these questions are seen, their identity is missed.
Consider those art-problems that (though never comprehended in their depths)
were evinced in the disputes between form and content, line and space, drawing
and colour, in the notion of style, in the idea of Impressionism and the music
of Wagner. Consider the decline of art and the failing authority of science;
the grave problems arising out of the victory of the megalopolis over the
country-side, such as childlessness and land-depopulation; the place in society
of a fluctuating Fourth Estate; the crisis in materialism, in Socialism, in parliamentary
government; the position of the individual <span lang="fr"><i>vis-à-vis</i></span> the State; the
problem of private property with its pendant the problem of marriage. Consider
at the same time one fact taken from what is apparently an entirely different
field, the voluminous work that was being done in the domain of folk-psychology
on the origins of myths, arts, religions and thought—and done, moreover,
no longer from an ideal but from a strictly morphological standpoint. It
is my belief that every one of these questions was really aimed in the same
direction as every other, viz., towards that <em>one</em> Riddle of History that had never
yet emerged with sufficient distinctness in the human consciousness. The tasks
before men were not, as supposed, infinitely numerous—they were one and
the same task. Everyone had an inkling that this was so, but no one from his
own narrow standpoint had seen the single and comprehensive solution. And
yet it had been in the air since Nietzsche, and Nietzsche himself had gripped all
the decisive problems although, being a romantic, he had not dared to look
strict reality in the face.</p>

<p class='c001'>But herein precisely lies the inward necessity of the <em>stock-taking</em> doctrine, so
to call it. It had to come, and it could only come at this time. Our scepticism
is not an attack upon, but rather the verification of, our stock of thoughts and
works. It <em>confirms</em> all that has been sought and achieved for generations past,
in that it integrates all the truly living tendencies which it finds in the special
spheres, no matter what their aim may be.</p>

<p class='c001'>Above all, there discovered itself the <em>opposition of History and Nature</em> through
which alone it is possible to grasp the essence of the former. As I have
already said, man as an element and representative of the World is a member,
not only of nature, but also of history—which is a second Cosmos different in
structure and complexion, entirely neglected by Metaphysics in favour of the
first. I was originally brought to reflect on this <em>fundamental</em> question of our
world-consciousness through noticing how present-day historians as they
fumble round tangible events, things-become, believe themselves to have already
grasped History, the happening, the becoming itself. This is a prejudice
common to all who proceed by reason and cognition, as against intuitive perception.<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c019'><sup>[40]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>And it had long ago been a source of perplexity to the great Eleatics
with their doctrine that through cognition there could be no becoming, but
only a being (or having-become). In other words, History was seen as Nature
(in the objective sense of the physicist) and treated accordingly, and it is to
this that we must ascribe the baneful mistake of applying the principles of
causality, of law, of system—that is, the structure of rigid being—to the
picture of happenings. It was assumed that a human culture existed just as
electricity or gravitation existed, and that it was capable of analysis in much
the same way as these. The habits of the scientific researcher were eagerly taken
as a model, and if, from time to time, some student asked what Gothic, or
Islam, or the Polis <em>was</em>, no one inquired why such symbols of something living
<em>inevitably</em> appeared just <em>then, and there, in that form, and for that space of time</em>.
Historians were content, whenever they met one of the innumerable similarities
between widely discrete historical phenomena, simply to register it, adding
some clever remarks as to the marvels of coincidence, dubbing Rhodes the
“Venice of Antiquity” and Napoleon the “modern Alexander,” or the like;
yet it was just these cases, in which the <em>destiny-problem</em> came to the fore as the
true problem of history (viz., the problem of time), that needed to be treated
with all possible seriousness and scientifically regulated <em>physiognomic</em> in order
to find out what strangely-constituted necessity, so completely alien to the
causal, was at work. That every phenomenon <span lang="la"><i>ipso facto</i></span> propounds a metaphysical
riddle, that the time of its occurrence is <em>never</em> irrelevant; that it still
remained to be discovered what kind of a <em>living</em> interdependence (apart from the
inorganic, natural-law interdependence) subsists within the world-picture,
which radiates from nothing less than the whole man and not merely (as Kant
thought) from the cognizing part of him; that a phenomenon is not only a fact
for the understanding but also an expression of the spiritual, not only an object
but a symbol as well, be it one of the highest creations of religion or art or a
mere trifle of everyday life—all this was, philosophically, something new.</p>

<p class='c001'>And thus in the end I came to see the solution clearly before me in immense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>outlines, possessed of full inward necessity, a solution derived from one single
principle that though discoverable had never been discovered, that from my
youth had haunted and attracted me, tormenting me with the sense that it was
there and must be attacked and yet defying me to seize it. Thus, from an almost
accidental occasion of beginning, there has arisen the present work, which is
put forward as the provisional expression of a new world-picture. The book is
laden, as I know, with all the defects of a first attempt, incomplete, and certainly
not free from inconsistencies. Nevertheless I am convinced that it contains
the incontrovertible formulation of an idea which, once enunciated
clearly, will (I repeat) be accepted without dispute.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, then, the narrower theme is an analysis of the Decline of that West-European
Culture which is now spread over the entire globe, yet the object in
view is the development of a philosophy and of the operative method peculiar
to it, which is now to be tried, viz., the method of comparative morphology in
world-history. The work falls naturally into two parts. The first, “Form and
Actuality,” starts from the form-language of the great Cultures, attempts to
penetrate to the deepest roots of their origin and so provides itself with the
basis for a science of Symbolic. The second part, “World-historical Perspectives,”
starts from the <em>facts of actual life</em>, and from the historical practice of
higher mankind seeks to obtain a quintessence of historical experience that we
can set to work upon the formation of our own future.</p>

<p class='c001'>The accompanying tables<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c019'><sup>[41]</sup></a> present a general view of what has resulted from
the investigation. They may at the same time give some notion both of the
fruitfulness and of the scope of the new methods.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER II<br> <br> THE MEANING OF NUMBERS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is necessary to begin by drawing attention to certain basic terms which, as
used in this work, carry strict and in some cases novel connotations. Though the
metaphysical content of these terms would gradually become evident in following
the course of the reasoning, nevertheless, the exact significance to be attached
to them ought to be made clear beyond misunderstanding from the very outset.</p>

<p class='c001'>The popular distinction—current also in philosophy—between “being”
and “becoming” seems to miss the essential point in the contrast it is meant to
express. An endless becoming—“action,” “actuality”—will always be
thought of also as a condition (as it is, for example, in physical notions such as
uniform velocity and the condition of motion, and in the basic hypothesis of
the kinetic theory of gases) and therefore ranked in the category of “being.”
On the other hand, out of the results that we do in fact obtain by and in consciousness,
we may, with Goethe, distinguish as final elements “becoming”
and “the become” (<span lang="de"><i>Das Werden</i></span>, <span lang="de"><i>das Gewordne</i></span>). In all cases, though the atom
of human-ness may lie beyond the grasp of our powers of abstract conception,
the very clear and definite <em>feeling</em> of this contrast—fundamental and diffused
throughout consciousness—is the most elemental something that we reach.
It necessarily follows therefore that “the become” is always founded on a
“becoming” and not the other way round.</p>

<p class='c001'>I distinguish further, by the words “proper” and “alien” (<span lang="de"><i>das Eigne</i></span>, <span lang="de"><i>das
Fremde</i></span>), those two basic facts of consciousness which for all men in the waking
(not in the dreaming) state are established with an immediate inward certainty,
without the necessity or possibility of more precise definition. The
element called “alien” is always related in some way to the basic fact expressed
by the word “perception,” i.e., the outer world, the life of sensation. Great
thinkers have bent all their powers of image-forming to the task of expressing
this relation, more and more rigorously, by the aid of half-intuitive dichotomies
such as “phenomena and things-in-themselves,” “world-as-will and world-as-idea,”
“ego and non-ego,” although human powers of exact knowing are
surely inadequate for the task.</p>

<p class='c001'>Similarly, the element “proper” is involved with the basic fact known as
feeling, i.e., the inner life, in some intimate and invariable way that equally
defies analysis by the methods of abstract thought.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>I distinguish, again, “soul” and “world.” <em>The existence of this opposition is
identical with the fact of purely human waking consciousness (Wachsein).</em> There are
degrees of clearness and sharpness in the opposition and therefore grades of the
consciousness, of the spirituality, of life. These grades range from the feeling-knowledge
that, unalert yet sometimes suffused through and through by an
inward light, is characteristic of the primitive and of the child (and also of those
moments of religious and artistic inspiration that occur ever less and less often
as a Culture grows older) right to the extremity of waking and reasoning sharpness
that we find, for instance, in the thought of Kant and Napoleon, for whom
soul and world have become subject and object. This elementary structure of
consciousness, as a fact of immediate inner knowledge, is not susceptible of
conceptual subdivision. Nor, indeed, are the two factors distinguishable at
all except verbally and more or less artificially, since they are always associated,
always intertwined, and present themselves as a unit, a totality. The epistemological
starting-point of the born idealist and the born realist alike, the
assumption that soul is to world (or world to soul, as the case may be) as foundation
is to building, as primary to derivative, as “cause” to “effect,” has no
basis whatever in the pure fact of consciousness, and when a philosophic system
lays stress on the one or the other, it only thereby informs us as to the personality
of the philosopher, a fact of purely biographical significance.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus, by regarding waking-consciousness structurally as a tension of contraries,
and applying to it the notions of “becoming” and “the thing-become,”
we find for the word <em>Life</em> a perfectly definite meaning that is closely allied to
that of “becoming.” We may describe becomings and the things-become as
the form in which respectively the facts and the results of life exist in the waking
consciousness. To man in the waking state his proper life, progressive and
constantly self-fulfilling, is presented through the element of Becoming in his
consciousness—<i>this fact we call “the present”</i>—and it possesses that mysterious
property of <em>Direction</em> which in all the higher languages men have sought to impound
and—vainly—to rationalize by means of the enigmatic word <em>time</em>.
It follows necessarily from the above that there is a fundamental connexion
between <em>the become</em> (the <em>hard-set</em>) and <em>Death</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, now, we designate the Soul—that is, the Soul as it is felt, not as it is
reasonably pictured—as the <em>possible</em> and the World on the other hand as the
<em>actual</em> (the meaning of these expressions is unmistakable to man’s inner sense),
we see life as <em>the form in which the actualizing of the possible is accomplished</em>. With
respect to the property of Direction, the possible is called the <em>Future</em> and the
actualized the <em>Past</em>. The actualizing itself, the centre-of-gravity and the centre-of-meaning
of life, we call the <em>Present</em>. “Soul” is the still-to-be-accomplished,
“World” the accomplished, “life” the accomplishing. In this way we are
enabled to assign to expressions like moment, duration, development, life-content,
vocation, scope, aim, fullness and emptiness of life, the definite meanings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>which we shall need for all that follows and especially for the understanding
of historical phenomena.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lastly, the words <em>History</em> and <em>Nature</em> are here employed, as the reader will
have observed already, in a quite definite and hitherto unusual sense. These
words comprise <em>possible</em> modes of understanding, of comprehending the totality
of knowledge—becoming as well as things-become, life as well as things-lived—as
a homogeneous, spiritualized, well-ordered <em>world-picture</em> fashioned out of
an indivisible mass-impression in this way or in that according as the becoming
or the become, direction (“time”) or extension (“space”) is the dominant
factor. And it is not a question of one factor being alternative to the other.
The possibilities that we have of possessing an “outer world” that reflects and
attests our proper existence are infinitely numerous and exceedingly heterogeneous,
and the purely organic and the purely mechanical world-view (in the
precise literal sense of that familiar term<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c019'><sup>[42]</sup></a>) are only the extreme members of the
series. Primitive man (so far as we can imagine his waking-consciousness) and
the child (as we can remember) cannot fully see or grasp these possibilities.
One condition of this higher world-consciousness is the possession of <em>language</em>,
meaning thereby not mere human utterance but a culture-language, and such
is non-existent for primitive man and existent but not accessible in the case of
the child. In other words, neither possesses any clear and distinct notion of the
world. They have an inkling but no real knowledge of history and nature,
being too intimately incorporated with the ensemble of these. <em>They have no
Culture.</em></p>

<p class='c001'>And therewith that important word is given a positive meaning of the highest
significance which henceforward will be assumed in using it. In the same
way as we have elected to distinguish the Soul as the possible and the World
as the actual, we can now differentiate between <em>possible</em> and <em>actual</em> culture, i.e.,
culture as <em>an idea in the</em> (general or individual) <em>existence</em> and culture as the <em>body</em>
of that idea, as the total of its visible, tangible and comprehensible expressions—acts
and opinions, religion and state, arts and sciences, peoples and cities,
economic and social forms, speech, laws, customs, characters, facial lines and
costumes. <em>Higher history</em>, intimately related to life and to becoming, <em>is the
actualizing of possible Culture</em>.<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c019'><sup>[43]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>We must not omit to add that these basic determinations of meaning are
largely incommunicable by specification, definition or proof, and in their deeper
import must be reached by feeling, experience and intuition. There is a distinction,
rarely appreciated as it should be, between experience as lived and experience
as learned (zwischen Erleben und Erkennen), between the immediate
certainty given by the various kinds of intuition—such as illumination,
inspiration, artistic flair, experience of life, the power of “sizing men up”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>(Goethe’s “exact percipient fancy”)—and the product of rational procedure
and technical experiment.</p>

<p class='c001'>The first are imparted by means of analogy, picture, symbol, the second by
formula, law, scheme. The become is experienced by learning—indeed, as we
shall see, the having-become is for the human mind identical with the completed
act of cognition. A becoming, on the other hand, can only be experienced
by living, felt with a deep wordless understanding. It is on this that
what we call “knowledge of men” is based; in fact the understanding of history
implies a superlative knowledge of men. The eye which can see into the
depths of an alien soul—owes nothing to the cognition-methods investigated
in the “Critique of Pure Reason,” yet the purer the historical picture is, the less
accessible it becomes to any other eye. The mechanism of a pure nature-picture,
such as the world of Newton and Kant, is cognized, grasped, dissected in laws
and equations and finally reduced to system: the organism of a pure history-picture,
like the world of Plotinus, Dante and Giordano Bruno, is intuitively
seen, inwardly experienced, grasped as a form or symbol and finally rendered in
poetical and artistic conceptions. Goethe’s “living nature” is a <em>historical</em>
world-picture.<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c019'><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c016'>II</h3>

<p class='c018'>In order to exemplify the way in which a soul seeks to actualize itself in the
picture of its outer world—to show, that is, in how far Culture in the “become”
state can express or portray an idea of human existence—I have chosen
<em>number</em>, the primary element on which all mathematics rests. I have done so
because mathematics, accessible in its full depth only to the very few, holds a
quite peculiar position amongst the creations of the mind. It is a science of the
most rigorous kind, like logic but more comprehensive and very much fuller;
it is a true art, along with sculpture and music, as needing the guidance of inspiration
and as developing under great conventions of form; it is, lastly, a
metaphysic of the highest rank, as Plato and above all Leibniz show us.
Every philosophy has hitherto grown up in conjunction with a mathematic
<em>belonging</em> to it. Number is the symbol of causal necessity. Like the conception
of God, it contains the ultimate meaning of the world-as-nature. The existence
of numbers may therefore be called a mystery, and the religious thought
of every Culture has felt their impress.<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c019'><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Just as all becoming possesses the original property of <em>direction</em> (irreversibility),
all things-become possess the property of <em>extension</em>. But these two
words seem unsatisfactory in that only an artificial distinction can be made
between them. The real secret of all things-become, which are <span lang="la"><i>ipso facto</i></span> things
extended (spatially and materially), is embodied in mathematical number as
contrasted with chronological number. Mathematical number contains in its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>very essence the notion of a <em>mechanical demarcation</em>, number being in that respect
akin to <em>word</em>, which, in the very fact of its comprising and denoting, fences off
world-impressions. The deepest depths, it is true, are here both incomprehensible
and inexpressible. But the actual number with which the mathematician
works, the figure, formula, sign, diagram, in short the <em>number-sign which he
thinks, speaks or writes exactly</em>, is (like the exactly-used word) from the first a
symbol of these depths, something imaginable, communicable, comprehensible
to the inner and the outer eye, which can be accepted as representing the demarcation.
The origin of numbers resembles that of the myth. Primitive man
elevates indefinable nature-impressions (the “alien,” in our terminology) into
deities, <em>numina</em>, at the same time capturing and impounding them by a <em>name</em>
which limits them. So also numbers are something that marks off and captures
nature-impressions, and it is by means of names and numbers that the human
understanding obtains power over the world. In the last analysis, the number-language
of a mathematic and the grammar of a tongue are structurally alike.
Logic is always a kind of mathematic and vice versa. Consequently, in all acts
of the intellect germane to mathematical number—measuring, counting,
drawing, weighing, arranging and dividing<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c019'><sup>[46]</sup></a>—men strive to delimit the extended
in words as well, i.e., to set it forth in the form of proofs, conclusions,
theorems and systems; and it is only through acts of this kind (which may be
more or less unintentioned) that waking man begins to be able to use numbers,
normatively, to specify objects and properties, relations and differentiæ, unities
and pluralities—briefly, that structure of the world-picture which he feels as
necessary and unshakable, calls “Nature” and “cognizes.” <em>Nature is the
numerable</em>, while History, on the other hand, is the aggregate of that which has
no relation to mathematics—hence the mathematical certainty of the laws of
Nature, the astounding rightness of Galileo’s saying that Nature is “written
in mathematical language,” and the fact, emphasized by Kant, that exact
natural science reaches just as far as the possibilities of applied mathematics
allow it to reach. In number, then, as the <em>sign of completed demarcation</em>, lies the
<em>essence</em> of everything actual, which is cognized, is delimited, and has become all
at once—as Pythagoras and certain others have been able to see with complete
inward certitude by a mighty and truly religious intuition. Nevertheless,
mathematics—meaning thereby the capacity to think practically in figures—must
not be confused with the far narrower scientific mathematics, that is, the
<em>theory</em> of numbers as developed in lecture and treatise. The mathematical vision
and thought that a Culture possesses within itself is as inadequately represented
by its written mathematic as its philosophical vision and thought by its
philosophical treatises. Number springs from a source that has also quite
other outlets. Thus at the beginning of every Culture we find an archaic style,
which might fairly have been called geometrical in other cases as well as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Early Hellenic. There is a common factor which is expressly mathematical
in this early Classical style of the 10th Century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, in the temple style of the
Egyptian Fourth Dynasty with its absolutism of straight line and right angle,
in the Early Christian sarcophagus-relief, and in Romanesque construction and
ornament. Here every line, every deliberately non-imitative figure of man and
beast, reveals a mystic number-thought in direct connexion with the mystery of
death (the hard-set).</p>

<p class='c001'>Gothic cathedrals and Doric temples are <em>mathematics in stone</em>. Doubtless
Pythagoras was the first in the Classical Culture to conceive number scientifically
as the principle of a world-order of comprehensible things—as <em>standard</em>
and as <em>magnitude</em>—but even before him it had found expression, as a noble
arraying of sensuous-material units, in the strict canon of the statue and the
Doric order of columns. The great arts are, one and all, modes of interpretation
by means of limits based on number (consider, for example, the problem of
space-representation in oil painting). A high mathematical endowment may,
without any mathematical science whatsoever, come to fruition and full self-knowledge
in <em>technical</em> spheres.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the presence of so powerful a number-sense as that evidenced, even in the
Old Kingdom,<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c019'><sup>[47]</sup></a> in the dimensioning of pyramid temples and in the technique
of building, water-control and public administration (not to mention the
calendar), no one surely would maintain that the valueless arithmetic of
Ahmes belonging to the New Empire represents the level of Egyptian mathematics.
The Australian natives, who rank intellectually as thorough primitives,
possess a mathematical instinct (or, what comes to the same thing, a
power of thinking in numbers which is not yet communicable by signs or words)
that as regards the interpretation of pure space is far superior to that of the
Greeks. Their discovery of the boomerang can only be attributed to their
having a sure feeling for numbers of a class that we should refer to the higher
geometry. <em>Accordingly</em>—we shall justify the adverb later—they possess an
extraordinarily complicated ceremonial and, for expressing degrees of affinity,
such fine shades of language as not even the higher Cultures themselves can
show.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is analogy, again, between the Euclidean mathematic and the absence,
in the Greek of the mature Periclean age, of any feeling either for ceremonial
public life or for loneliness, while the Baroque, differing sharply from the
Classical, presents us with a mathematic of spatial analysis, a court of Versailles
and a state system resting on dynastic relations.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is the style of a Soul that comes out in the world of numbers, and the
world of numbers includes something more than the science thereof.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>
  <h3 class='c016'>III</h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>From this there follows a fact of decisive importance which has hitherto
been hidden from the mathematicians themselves.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>There is not, and cannot be, number as such.</em> There are several number-worlds
as there are several Cultures. We find an Indian, an Arabian, a Classical, a
Western type of mathematical thought and, corresponding with each, a type
of number—each type fundamentally peculiar and unique, an expression of a
specific world-feeling, a symbol having a specific validity which is even capable
of scientific definition, a principle of ordering the Become which reflects the
central essence of one and only one soul, viz., the soul of that particular Culture.
Consequently, there are more mathematics than one. For indubitably
the inner structure of the Euclidean geometry is something quite different from
that of the Cartesian, the analysis of Archimedes is something other than the
analysis of Gauss, and not merely in matters of form, intuition and method but
above all in essence, in the intrinsic and obligatory meaning of number which
they respectively develop and set forth. This number, the horizon within
which it has been able to make phenomena self-explanatory, and therefore the
whole of the “nature” or world-extended that is confined in the given limits
and amenable to its particular sort of mathematic, are not common to all mankind,
but specific in each case to one definite sort of mankind.</p>

<p class='c001'>The style of any mathematic which comes into being, then, depends wholly
on the Culture in which it is rooted, the sort of mankind it is that ponders it.
The soul can bring its inherent possibilities to scientific development, can
manage them practically, can attain the highest levels in its treatment of them—but
is quite impotent to alter them. The idea of the Euclidean geometry is
actualized in the earliest forms of Classical ornament, and that of the Infinitesimal
Calculus in the earliest forms of Gothic architecture, centuries before
the first learned mathematicians of the respective Cultures were born.</p>

<p class='c001'>A deep inward experience, the genuine <em>awakening of the ego</em>, which turns the
child into the higher man and initiates him into community of his Culture,
marks the beginning of number-sense as it does that of language-sense. It is
only after this that objects come to exist for the waking consciousness as things
limitable and distinguishable as to number and kind; only after this that properties,
concepts, causal necessity, system in the world-around, <em>a form of the
world</em>, and <em>world laws</em> (for that which is set and settled is <span lang="la"><i>ipso facto</i></span> bounded,
hardened, number-governed) are susceptible of exact definition. And therewith
comes too a sudden, almost metaphysical, feeling of anxiety and awe regarding
the deeper meaning of measuring and counting, drawing and form.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, Kant has classified the sum of human knowledge according to syntheses
<span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> (necessary and universally valid) and <span lang="la"><i>a posteriori</i></span> (experiential and
variable from case to case) and in the former class has included mathematical
knowledge. Thereby, doubtless, he was enabled to reduce a strong inward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>feeling to abstract form. But, quite apart from the fact (amply evidenced in
modern mathematics and mechanics) that there is no such sharp distinction
between the two as is originally and unconditionally implied in the principle,
the <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> itself, though certainly one of the most inspired conceptions of
philosophy, is a notion that seems to involve enormous difficulties. With it
Kant postulates—without attempting to prove what is quite incapable of
proof—both <em>unalterableness of form</em> in all intellectual activity and <em>identity of
form for all men</em> in the same. And, in consequence, a factor of incalculable importance
is—thanks to the intellectual prepossessions of his period, not to
mention his own—simply ignored. This factor is the <em>varying degree</em> of this
alleged “universal validity.” There are doubtless certain characters of very
wide-ranging validity which are (seemingly at any rate) independent of the
Culture and century to which the cognizing individual may belong, but along
with these there is a quite particular necessity of form which underlies all his
thought as axiomatic and to which he is subject by virtue of belonging to his
own Culture and no other. Here, then, we have two very different kinds of <em>a
priori</em> thought-content, and the definition of a frontier between them, or even
the demonstration that such exists, is a problem that lies beyond all possibilities
of knowing and will never be solved. So far, no one has dared to assume
that the supposed constant structure of the intellect is an illusion and that the
history spread out before us contains more than one <em>style of knowing</em>. But we
must not forget that unanimity about things that have not yet become problems
may just as well imply universal error as universal truth. True, there has
always been a certain sense of doubt and obscurity—so much so, that the
correct guess might have been made from that non-agreement of the philosophers
which every glance at the history of philosophy shows us. But that this
non-agreement is not due to imperfections of the human intellect or present
gaps in a perfectible knowledge, in a word, is not due to defect, but to destiny
and historical necessity—this is a <em>discovery</em>. Conclusions on the deep and final
things are to be reached not by predicating constants but by studying differentiæ
and developing the <em>organic logic</em> of differences. The <em>comparative morphology
of knowledge forms</em> is a domain which Western thought has still to attack.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>IV</h4>

<p class='c018'>If mathematics were a mere science like astronomy or mineralogy, it would
be possible to define their object. This man is not and never has been able to do.
We West-Europeans may put our own scientific notion of number to perform
the same tasks as those with which the mathematicians of Athens and Baghdad
busied themselves, but the fact remains that the theme, the intention and the
methods of the like-named science in Athens and in Baghdad were quite different
from those of our own. <em>There is no mathematic but only mathematics.</em> What
we call “the history of mathematics”—implying merely the progressive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>actualizing of a single invariable ideal—is in fact, below the deceptive surface
of history, a complex of self-contained and independent developments, an ever-repeated
process of bringing to birth new form-worlds and appropriating,
transforming and sloughing alien form-worlds, a purely organic story of blossoming,
ripening, wilting and dying within the set period. The student must
not let himself be deceived. The mathematic of the Classical soul sprouted
almost out of nothingness, the historically-constituted Western soul, already
possessing the Classical science (not inwardly, but outwardly as a thing learnt),
had to win its own by apparently altering and perfecting, but in reality destroying
the essentially alien Euclidean system. In the first case, the agent was Pythagoras,
in the second Descartes. In both cases the act is, at bottom, the same.</p>

<p class='c001'>The relationship between the form-language of a mathematic and that of
the cognate major arts,<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c019'><sup>[48]</sup></a> is in this way put beyond doubt. The temperament of
the thinker and that of the artist differ widely indeed, but the expression-methods
of the waking consciousness are inwardly the same for each. The sense
of form of the sculptor, the painter, the composer is essentially mathematical
in its nature. The same inspired ordering of an infinite world which manifested
itself in the geometrical analysis and projective geometry of the 17th Century,
could vivify, energize, and suffuse contemporary music with the harmony that
it developed out of the art of thoroughbass, (which is the geometry of the
sound-world) and contemporary painting with the principle of perspective
(the felt geometry of the space-world that only the West knows). This inspired
ordering is that which Goethe called “<em>The Idea, of which the form is immediately
apprehended in the domain of intuition</em>, whereas pure science does not apprehend
but observes and dissects.” The Mathematic goes beyond observation and
dissection, and in its highest moments finds the way by vision, not abstraction.
To Goethe again we owe the profound saying: “the mathematician is only
complete in so far as he feels within himself the <em>beauty</em> of the true.” Here we
feel how nearly the secret of number is related to the secret of artistic creation.
And so the born mathematician takes his place by the side of the great masters
of the fugue, the chisel and the brush; he and they alike strive, and must strive,
to actualize the grand order of all things by clothing it in symbol and so to
communicate it to the plain fellow-man who hears that order within himself
but cannot effectively possess it; the domain of number, like the domains of
tone, line and colour, becomes an image of the world-form. For this reason
the word “creative” means more in the mathematical sphere than it does in the
pure sciences—Newton, Gauss, and Riemann were artist-natures, and we
know with what suddenness their great conceptions came upon them.<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c019'><sup>[49]</sup></a> “A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>mathematician,” said old Weierstrass “who is not at the same time a bit of a
poet will never be a full mathematician.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The mathematic, then, is an art. As such it has its styles and style-periods.
It is not, as the layman and the philosopher (who is in this matter a layman
too) imagine, substantially unalterable, but subject like every art to unnoticed
changes from epoch to epoch. The development of the great arts ought
never to be treated without an (assuredly not unprofitable) side-glance at contemporary
mathematics. In the very deep relation between changes of musical
theory and the analysis of the infinite, the details have never yet been investigated,
although æsthetics might have learned a great deal more from these
than from all so-called “psychology.” Still more revealing would be a history
of musical instruments written, not (as it always is) from the technical standpoint
of tone-production, but as a study of the deep spiritual bases of the tone-colours
and tone-effects aimed at. For it was the wish, intensified to the point
of a longing, to fill a spatial infinity with sound which produced—in contrast
to the Classical lyre and reed (lyra, kithara; aulos, syrinx) and the Arabian
lute—the two great families of keyboard instruments (organ, pianoforte, etc.)
and bow instruments, and that as early as the Gothic time. The development
of both these families belongs spiritually (and possibly also in point of technical
origin) to the Celtic-Germanic North lying between Ireland, the Weser and the
Seine. The organ and clavichord belong certainly to England, the bow instruments
reached their definite forms in Upper Italy between 1480 and 1530,
while it was principally in Germany that the organ was developed into the
<em>space-commanding</em> giant that we know, an instrument the like of which does not
exist in all musical history. The free organ-playing of Bach and his time was
nothing if it was not analysis—analysis of a strange and vast tone-world.
And, similarly, it is in conformity with the Western number-thinking, and in
opposition to the Classical, that our string and wind instruments have been
developed not singly but in great groups (strings, woodwind, brass), ordered
within themselves according to the compass of the four human voices; the
history of the modern orchestra, with all its discoveries of new and modification
of old instruments, is in reality the self-contained history of one tone-world—a
world, moreover, that is quite capable of being expressed in the forms of the
higher analysis.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>V</h4>

<p class='c018'>When, about 540 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, the circle of the Pythagoreans arrived at the idea that
<em>number is the essence of all things</em>, it was not “a step in the development of mathematics”
that was made, but a wholly new mathematic that was born. Long
heralded by metaphysical problem-posings and artistic form-tendencies, now it
came forth from the depths of the Classical soul as a formulated theory, a
mathematic born in one act at one great historical moment—just as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>mathematic of the Egyptians had been, and the algebra-astronomy of the
Babylonian Culture with its ecliptic co-ordinate system—and new—for these
older mathematics had long been extinguished and the Egyptian was never
written down. Fulfilled by the 2nd century <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, the Classical mathematic
vanished in its turn (for though it seemingly exists even to-day, it is only as a
convenience of notation that it does so), and gave place to the Arabian. From
what we know of the Alexandrian mathematic, it is a necessary presumption
that there was a great movement within the Middle East, of which the centre
of gravity must have lain in the Persian-Babylonian schools (such as Edessa,
Gundisapora and Ctesiphon) and of which only details found their way into
the regions of Classical speech. In spite of their Greek names, the Alexandrian
mathematicians—Zenodorus who dealt with figures of equal perimeter,
Serenus who worked on the properties of a harmonic pencil in space, Hypsicles
who introduced the Chaldean circle-division, Diophantus above all—were
all without doubt Aramæans, and their works only a small part of a literature
which was written principally in Syriac. This mathematic found its completion
in the investigations of the Arabian-Islamic thinkers, and after these
there was again a long interval. And then a perfectly new mathematic was
born, the Western, <em>our own</em>, which in our infatuation we regard as “Mathematics,”
as the culmination and the implicit purpose of two thousand years’
evolution, though in reality its centuries are (strictly) numbered and to-day
almost spent.</p>

<p class='c001'>The most valuable thing in the Classical mathematic is its proposition that
number is the essence of all things <em>perceptible to the senses</em>. Defining number as a
measure, it contains the whole world-feeling of a soul passionately devoted to
the “here” and the “now.” Measurement in this sense means the measurement
of something near and corporeal. Consider the content of the Classical
art-work, say the free-standing statue of a naked man; here every essential and
important element of Being, its whole rhythm, is exhaustively rendered by
surfaces, dimensions and the sensuous relations of the parts. The Pythagorean
notion of the harmony of numbers, although it was probably deduced from
music—a music, be it noted, that knew not polyphony or harmony, and
formed its instruments to render single plump, almost fleshy, tones—seems to
be the very mould for a sculpture that has this ideal. The worked stone is only
a something in so far as it has considered limits and measured form; what it <em>is</em>
is what it <em>has become</em> under the sculptor’s chisel. Apart from this it is a <em>chaos</em>,
something not yet actualized, in fact for the time being a null. The same feeling
transferred to the grander stage produces, as an opposite to the state of chaos,
that of <em>cosmos</em>, which for the Classical soul implies a cleared-up situation of the
external world, a harmonic order which includes each separate thing as a well-defined,
comprehensible and present entity. The sum of such things constitutes
neither more nor less than the whole world, and the interspaces between them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>which for us are filled with the impressive symbol of the Universe of Space, are
for them the nonent (τὸ μὴ ὅν).</p>

<p class='c001'>Extension means, for Classical mankind body, and for us space, and it is
as a function of space that, to us, things “appear.” And, looking backward
from this standpoint, we may perhaps see into the deepest concept of the Classical
metaphysics, Anaximander’s ἄπειρον—a word that is quite untranslatable
into any Western tongue. It is that which possesses no “number” in the
Pythagorean sense of the word, no measurable dimensions or definable limits,
and therefore no being; the measureless, the negation of form, the statue not yet
carved out of the block; the ἀρχὴ optically boundless and formless, which only
becomes a something (namely, the world) after being split up by the senses.
It is the underlying form <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> of Classical cognition, bodiliness as such, which
is replaced exactly in the Kantian world-picture by that Space out of which
Kant maintained that all things could be “thought forth.”</p>

<p class='c001'>We can now understand what it is that divides one mathematic from another,
and in particular the Classical from the Western. The whole world-feeling
of the matured Classical world led it to see mathematics only as the
theory of relations of magnitude, dimension and form between bodies. When,
from out of this feeling, Pythagoras evolved and expressed the decisive formula,
number had come, for him, to be an <em>optical</em> symbol—not a measure of form
generally, an abstract relation, but a frontier-post of the domain of the Become,
or rather of that part of it which the senses were able to split up and pass under
review. By the whole Classical world without exception numbers are conceived
as units of measure, as magnitude, lengths, or surfaces, and for it no
other sort of extension is imaginable. The whole Classical mathematic is at
bottom <em>Stereometry</em> (solid geometry). To Euclid, who rounded off its system in
the third century, the triangle is of deep necessity the bounding surface of a
body, never a system of three intersecting straight lines or a group of three
points in three-dimensional space. He defines a line as “length without
breadth” (μῆκος ἀπλατές). In our mouths such a definition would be pitiful—in
the Classical mathematic it was brilliant.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Western number, too, is not, as Kant and even Helmholtz thought,
something proceeding out of Time as an <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> form of conception, but is something
specifically spatial, in that it is an order (or ordering) of like units.
Actual time (as we shall see more and more clearly in the sequel) has not the
slightest relation with mathematical things. Numbers belong exclusively to
the domain of extension. But there are precisely as many possibilities—and
therefore necessities—of ordered presentation of the extended as there are
Cultures. Classical number is a thought-process dealing not with spatial relations
but with visibly limitable and tangible units, and it follows naturally
and necessarily that the Classical knows only the “natural” (positive and
whole) numbers, which on the contrary play in our Western mathematics a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>quite undistinguished part in the midst of complex, hypercomplex, non-Archimedean
and other number-systems.</p>

<p class='c001'>On this account, the idea of irrational numbers—the unending decimal
fractions of our notation—was unrealizable within the Greek spirit. Euclid
says—and he ought to have been better understood—that incommensurable
lines are “<em>not related to one another like numbers</em>.” In fact, it is the idea of irrational
number that, once achieved, separates the notion of number from that of
magnitude, for the magnitude of such a number (π, for example) can never be
defined or exactly represented by any straight line. Moreover, it follows from
this that in considering the relation, say, between diagonal and side in a square
the Greek would be brought up suddenly against a quite other sort of number,
which was fundamentally alien to the Classical soul, and was consequently
feared as a secret of its proper existence too dangerous to be unveiled. There is
a singular and significant late-Greek legend, according to which the man who
first published the hidden mystery of the irrational perished by shipwreck,
“for the unspeakable and the formless must be left hidden for ever.”<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c019'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The fear that underlies this legend is the selfsame notion that prevented even
the ripest Greeks from extending their tiny city-states so as to organize the
country-side politically, from laying out their streets to end in prospects and
their alleys to give vistas, that made them recoil time and again from the
Babylonian astronomy with its penetration of endless starry space,<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c019'><sup>[51]</sup></a> and refuse
to venture out of the Mediterranean along sea-paths long before dared by the
Phœnicians and the Egyptians. It is the deep metaphysical fear that the sense-comprehensible
and present in which the Classical existence had entrenched
itself would collapse and precipitate its cosmos (largely created and sustained
by art) into unknown primitive abysses. And to understand this fear is to
understand the final significance of Classical number—that is, <em>measure in contrast
to the immeasurable</em>—and to grasp the high ethical significance of its
limitation. Goethe too, as a nature-student, felt it—hence his almost terrified
aversion to mathematics, which as we can now see was really an involuntary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>reaction against the <em>non-Classical</em> mathematic, the Infinitesimal Calculus
which underlay the natural philosophy of his time.</p>

<p class='c001'>Religious feeling in Classical man focused itself ever more and more intensely
upon physically present, <em>localized</em> cults which alone expressed a college of Euclidean
deities. Abstractions, <em>dogmas</em> floating homeless in the space of thought,
were ever alien to it. A cult of this kind has as much in common with a
Roman Catholic dogma as the statue has with the cathedral organ. There is no
doubt that something of cult was comprised in the Euclidean mathematic—consider,
for instance, the secret doctrines of the Pythagoreans and the Theorems
of regular polyhedrons with their esoteric significance in the circle of
Plato. Just so, there is a deep relation between Descartes’ analysis of the infinite
and contemporary dogmatic theology as it progressed from the final
decisions of the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation to entirely desensualized
deism. Descartes and Pascal were mathematicians and Jansenists, Leibniz a
mathematician and pietist. Voltaire, Lagrange and D’Alembert were contemporaries.
Now, the Classical soul felt the principle of the irrational, which
overturned the statuesquely-ordered array of whole numbers and the complete
and self-sufficing world-order for which these stood, as an impiety against the
Divine itself. In Plato’s “Timæus” this feeling is unmistakable. For the transformation
of a series of discrete numbers into a continuum challenged not merely
the Classical notion of number but the Classical world-idea itself, and so it is
understandable that even <em>negative</em> numbers, which to us offer no conceptual
difficulty, were impossible in the Classical mathematic, let alone <em>zero as a
number</em>, that refined creation of a wonderful abstractive power which, for
the Indian soul that conceived it as base for a positional numeration, was
nothing more nor less than the key to the meaning of existence. <em>Negative
magnitudes</em> have no existence. The expression <span class='math'>-2×-3=+6</span> is neither
something perceivable nor a representation of magnitude. The series of magnitudes
ends with +1, and in graphic representation of negative numbers</p>

<p class='c009'>we have suddenly, from zero onwards, <em>positive</em>
symbols of something negative; they <em>mean</em> something, but they no longer
<em>are</em>. But the fulfilment of this act did not lie within the direction of Classical
number-thinking.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every product of the waking consciousness of the Classical world, then, is
elevated to the rank of actuality by way of sculptural definition. That which
cannot be drawn is not “number.” Archytas and Eudoxus use the terms surface-
and volume-numbers to mean what we call second and third powers, and
it is easy to understand that the notion of higher integral powers did not
exist for them, for a fourth power would predicate at once, for the mind based
on the plastic feeling, an extension in four dimensions, and four <em>material</em> dimensions
into the bargain, “which is absurd.” Expressions like ε<sup>ix</sup> which we
constantly use, or even the fractional index (e.g., 5<sup>½</sup>) which is employed in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Western mathematics as early as Oresme (14th Century), would have been to
them utter nonsense. Euclid calls the factors of a product its sides πλευραί
and fractions (finite of course) were treated as whole-number relationships
between two lines. Clearly, out of this no conception of zero as a number could
possibly come, for from the point of view of a draughtsman it is meaningless.
We, having minds differently constituted, must not argue from our habits to
theirs and treat their mathematic as a “first stage” in the development of
“Mathematics.” Within and for the purposes of the world that Classical man
evolved for himself, the Classical mathematic was a complete thing—it is
merely not so <em>for us</em>. Babylonian and Indian mathematics had long contained,
as essential elements of <em>their</em> number-worlds, things which the Classical number-feeling
regarded as nonsense—and not from ignorance either, since many a
Greek thinker was acquainted with them. It must be repeated, “Mathematics”
is an illusion. A mathematical, and, generally, a scientific way of thinking is
right, convincing, a “necessity of thought,” when it completely expresses the
life-feeling proper to it. Otherwise it is either impossible, futile and senseless,
or else, as we in the arrogance of our historical soul like to say, “primitive.”
The modern mathematic, though “true” only for the Western spirit, is undeniably
a master-work of that spirit; and yet to Plato it would have seemed a
ridiculous and painful aberration from the path leading to the “true”—to wit,
the Classical—mathematic. And so with ourselves. Plainly, we have almost
no notion of the multitude of great ideas belonging to other Cultures that we
have suffered to lapse because <em>our</em> thought with its limitations has not permitted
us to assimilate them, or (which comes to the same thing) has led us to reject
them as false, superfluous, and nonsensical.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>VI</h4>

<p class='c018'>The Greek mathematic, as a science of perceivable magnitudes, deliberately
confines itself to facts of the comprehensibly present, and limits its researches
and their validity to the near and the small. As compared with this impeccable
consistency, the position of the Western mathematic is seen to be, practically,
somewhat illogical, though it is only since the discovery of Non-Euclidean
Geometry that the fact has been really recognized. Numbers are images of the
perfectly desensualized understanding, of pure thought, and contain their abstract
validity within themselves.<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c019'><sup>[52]</sup></a> Their exact application to the actuality of
conscious experience is therefore a problem in itself—a problem which is
always being posed anew and never solved—and the congruence of mathematical
system with empirical observation is at present anything but self-evident.
Although the lay idea—as found in Schopenhauer—is that mathematics
rest upon the direct evidences of the senses, Euclidean geometry,
superficially identical though it is with the popular geometry of all ages, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>only in agreement with the phenomenal world approximately and within very
narrow limits—in fact, the limits of a drawing-board. Extend these limits,
and what becomes, for instance, of Euclidean parallels? They meet at the line
of the horizon—a simple fact upon which all our art-perspective is grounded.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, it is unpardonable that Kant, a Western thinker, should have evaded
the mathematic of distance, and appealed to a set of figure-examples that their
mere pettiness excludes from treatment by the specifically Western infinitesimal
methods. But Euclid, as a thinker of the Classical age, was entirely consistent
with its spirit when he refrained from proving the phenomenal truth of his
axioms by referring to, say, the triangle formed by an observer and two infinitely
distant fixed stars. For these can neither be drawn nor “intuitively
apprehended” and his feeling was precisely the feeling which shrank from
the irrationals, which did not dare to give nothingness a value as zero (i.e.,
a number) and even in the contemplation of cosmic relations shut its eyes to
the Infinite and held to its symbol of Proportion.</p>

<p class='c001'>Aristarchus of Samos, who in 288-277 belonged to a circle of astronomers at
Alexandria that doubtless had relations with Chaldaeo-Persian schools, projected
the elements of a heliocentric world-system.<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c019'><sup>[53]</sup></a> Rediscovered by Copernicus,
it was to shake the metaphysical passions of the West to their foundations—witness
Giordano Bruno<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c019'><sup>[54]</sup></a>—to become the fulfilment of mighty premonitions,
and to justify that Faustian, Gothic world-feeling which had already
professed its faith in infinity through the forms of its cathedrals. But the world
of Aristarchus received his work with entire indifference and in a brief space of
time it was forgotten—designedly, we may surmise. His few followers were
nearly all natives of Asia Minor, his most prominent supporter Seleucus (about
150) being from the Persian Seleucia on Tigris. In fact, the Aristarchian system
had no spiritual appeal to the Classical Culture and might indeed have become
dangerous to it. And yet it was differentiated from the Copernican (a point
always missed) by something which made it perfectly conformable to the
Classical world-feeling, viz., the assumption that the cosmos is <em>contained</em> in a
materially finite and optically appreciable <em>hollow sphere</em>, in the middle of which
the planetary system, arranged as such on Copernican lines, moved. In the
Classical astronomy, the earth and the heavenly bodies are consistently regarded
as entities of two different kinds, however variously their movements
in detail might be interpreted. Equally, the opposite idea that the earth is
<em>only a star among stars</em><a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c019'><sup>[55]</sup></a> is not inconsistent in itself with either the Ptolemaic or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>the Copernican systems and in fact was pioneered by Nicolaus Cusanus and
Leonardo da Vinci. But by this device of a celestial sphere the principle of
infinity which would have endangered the sensuous-Classical notion of bounds
was smothered. One would have supposed that the infinity-conception was
inevitably implied by the system of Aristarchus—long before his time, the
Babylonian thinkers had reached it. But no such thought emerges. On the
contrary, in the famous treatise on the grains of sand<a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c019'><sup>[56]</sup></a> Archimedes proves that
the filling of this stereometric body (for that is what Aristarchus’s Cosmos is,
after all) with atoms of sand leads to very high, but <em>not</em> to infinite, figure-results.
This proposition, quoted though it may be, time and again, as being
a first step towards the Integral Calculus, amounts to a denial (implicit indeed
in the very title) of everything that we mean by the word analysis. Whereas
in our physics, the constantly-surging hypotheses of a material (i.e., directly
cognizable) æther, break themselves one after the other against our refusal to
acknowledge material limitations of any kind, Eudoxus, Apollonius and Archimedes,
certainly the keenest and boldest of the Classical mathematicians, completely
worked out, in the main with rule and compass, a <em>purely optical</em> analysis
of things-become on the basis of sculptural-Classical bounds. They used deeply-thought-out
(and for us hardly understandable) methods of integration, but
these possess only a superficial resemblance even to Leibniz’s definite-integral
method. They employed geometrical loci and co-ordinates, but these are always
specified lengths and units of measurement and never, as in Fermat and above all
in Descartes, unspecified spatial relations, values of points in terms of their
positions in space. With these methods also should be classed the exhaustion-method
of Archimedes,<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c019'><sup>[57]</sup></a> given by him in his recently discovered letter to Eratosthenes
on such subjects as the quadrature of the parabola section by means of
inscribed rectangles (instead of through similar polygons). But the very subtlety
and extreme complication of his methods, which are grounded in certain
of Plato’s geometrical ideas, make us realize, in spite of superficial analogies,
what an enormous difference separates him from Pascal. Apart altogether from
the idea of Riemann’s integral, what sharper contrast could there be to these
ideas than the so-called quadratures of to-day? The name itself is now no more
than an unfortunate survival, the “surface” is indicated by a bounding function,
and the <em>drawing</em> as such, has vanished. Nowhere else did the two mathematical
minds approach each other more closely than in this instance, and
nowhere is it more evident that the gulf between the two souls thus expressing
themselves is impassable.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the cubic style of their early architecture the Egyptians, so to say, concealed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>pure numbers, fearful of stumbling upon their secret, and for the Hellenes
too they were the key to the meaning of the become, the stiffened, the mortal.
The stone statue and the scientific system deny life. Mathematical number,
the formal principle of an extension-world of which the phenomenal existence
is only the derivative and servant of waking human consciousness, bears the
hall-mark of causal necessity and so is linked with <em>death</em> as chronological
number is with becoming, with <em>life</em>, with the necessity of destiny. This connexion
of strict mathematical form with the <em>end</em> of organic being, with the
phenomenon of its organic remainder the corpse, we shall see more and more
clearly to be the origin of all great art. We have already noticed the development
of early ornament on funerary equipments and receptacles. <em>Numbers are
symbols of the mortal.</em> Stiff forms are the negation of life, formulas and laws spread
rigidity over the face of nature, numbers make dead—and the “Mothers” of

<p class='c018'>Goethe draws very near to Plato in this divination of one of the final secrets.
For his unapproachable Mothers are Plato’s Ideas—the possibilities of a
spirituality, the unborn forms to be realized as active and purposed Culture, as
art, thought, polity and religion, in a world ordered and determined by that
spirituality. And so the number-thought and the world-idea of a Culture are
related, and by this relation, the former is elevated above mere knowledge and
experience and becomes a view of the universe, there being consequently as many
mathematics—as many number-worlds—as there are higher Cultures. Only
so can we understand, as something <em>necessary</em>, the fact that the greatest mathematical
thinkers, the creative artists of the realm of numbers, have been brought
to the decisive mathematical discoveries of their several Cultures by a deep
religious intuition.</p>

<p class='c001'>Classical, Apollinian number we must regard as the creation of Pythagoras—<em>who
founded a religion</em>. It was an instinct that guided Nicolaus Cusanus, the
great Bishop of Brixen (about 1450), from the idea of the unendingness of God
in nature to the elements of the Infinitesimal Calculus. Leibniz himself, who
two centuries later definitely settled the methods and notation of the Calculus,
was led by purely metaphysical speculations about the divine principle and its
relation to infinite extent to conceive and develop the notion of an <span lang="la"><i>analysis
situs</i></span>—probably the most inspired of all interpretations of pure and emancipated
space—the possibilities of which were to be developed later by Grassmann
in his <span lang="de"><cite>Ausdehnungslehre</cite></span> and above all by Riemann, their real creator, in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>symbolism of two-sided planes representative of the nature of equations. And
Kepler and Newton, strictly religious natures both, were and remained convinced,
like Plato, that it was precisely through the medium of number that
they had been able to apprehend intuitively the essence of the divine world-order.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>VII</h4>

<p class='c018'>The Classical arithmetic, we are always told, was first liberated from its
sense-bondage, widened and extended by Diophantus, who did not indeed
create algebra (the science of undefined magnitudes) but brought it to expression
within the framework of the Classical mathematic that we know—and so
suddenly that we have to assume that there was a pre-existent stock of ideas
which he worked out. But this amounts, not to an enrichment of, but a complete
victory over, the Classical world-feeling, and the mere fact should have
sufficed in itself to show that, inwardly, Diophantus does not belong to the
Classical Culture at all. What is active in him is a new number-feeling, or let
us say a new limit-feeling with respect to the actual and become, and no longer
that Hellenic feeling of sensuously-present limits which had produced the
Euclidean geometry, the nude statue and the coin. Details of the formation of
this new mathematic we do not know—Diophantus stands so completely by
himself in the history of so-called late-Classical mathematics that an Indian
influence has been presumed. But here also the influence it must really have
been that of those early-Arabian schools whose studies (apart from the
dogmatic) have hitherto been so imperfectly investigated. In Diophantus,
unconscious though he may be of his own essential antagonism to the Classical
foundations on which he attempted to build, there emerges from under the
surface of Euclidean <em>intention</em> the new limit-<em>feeling</em> which I designate the
“Magian.” He did not widen the idea of number as magnitude, but (unwittingly)
eliminated it. No Greek could have stated anything about an <em>undefined</em>
number <em>a</em> or an <em>undenominated</em> number 3—which are neither magnitudes nor
lines—whereas the new limit-feeling sensibly expressed by numbers of this
sort at least underlay, if it did not constitute, Diophantine treatment; and the
letter-notation which we employ to clothe our own (again transvalued) algebra
was first introduced by Vieta in 1591, an unmistakable, if unintended, protest
against the classicizing tendency of Renaissance mathematics.</p>

<p class='c001'>Diophantus lived about 250 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>, <em>that is, in the third century of that Arabian
Culture</em> whose organic history, till now smothered under the surface-forms of the
Roman Empire and the “Middle Ages,”<a id='r59'></a><a href='#f59' class='c019'><sup>[59]</sup></a> comprises everything that happened
after the beginning of our era in the region that was later to be Islam’s. It was
precisely in the time of Diophantus that the last shadow of the Attic statuary
art paled before the new space-sense of cupola, mosaic and sarcophagus-relief
that we have in the Early-Christian-Syrian style. In that time there was once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>more <em>archaic</em> art and strictly geometrical ornament; and at that time too Diocletian
completed the transformation of the now merely sham Empire into a
Caliphate. The four centuries that separate Euclid and Diophantus, separate
also Plato and Plotinus—the last and conclusive thinker, the Kant, of a
fulfilled Culture and the first schoolman, the Duns Scotus, of a Culture just
awakened.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is here that we are made aware for the first time of the existence of those
higher individualities whose coming, growth and decay constitute the <em>real
substance of history</em> underlying the myriad colours and changes of the surface.
The Classical spirituality, which reached its final phase in the cold intelligence
of the Romans and of which the whole Classical Culture with all its works,
thoughts, deeds and ruins forms the “body,” had been born about 1100 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> in
the country about the Ægean Sea. The Arabian Culture, which, under cover of
the Classical Civilization, had been germinating in the East since Augustus,
came wholly out of the region between Armenia and Southern Arabia, Alexandria
and Ctesiphon, and we have to consider as expressions of this new soul
almost the whole “late-Classical” art of the Empire, all the young ardent religions
of the East—Mandæanism, Manichæism, Christianity, Neo-Platonism,
and in Rome itself, as well as the Imperial Fora, that Pantheon which is the
<em>first of all mosques</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>That Alexandria and Antioch still wrote in Greek and imagined that they
were thinking in Greek is a fact of no more importance than the facts that
Latin was the scientific language of the West right up to the time of Kant and
that Charlemagne “renewed” the Roman Empire.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Diophantus, number has ceased to be the measure and essence of <em>plastic
things</em>. In the Ravennate mosaics man has ceased to be a <em>body</em>. Unnoticed, Greek
designations have lost their original connotations. We have left the realm of
Attic καλοκάγαθία the Stoic ἀταραξία and γαλήνη. Diophantus does not yet
know zero and negative numbers, it is true, but he has <em>ceased</em> to know Pythagorean
numbers. And this Arabian indeterminateness of number is, in its turn,
something quite different from the controlled variability of the later Western
mathematics, the variability of the <em>function</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Magian mathematic—we can see the outline, though we are ignorant of
the details—advanced through Diophantus (who is obviously not a starting-point)
boldly and logically to a culmination in the Abbassid period (9th century)
that we can appreciate in Al-Khwarizmi and Alsidzshi. And as Euclidean
geometry is to Attic statuary (the same expression-form in a different medium)
and the analysis of space to polyphonic music, so this algebra is to the Magian
art with its mosaic, its arabesque (which the Sassanid Empire and later Byzantium
produced with an ever-increasing profusion and luxury of tangible-intangible
organic motives) and its Constantinian high-relief in which uncertain
deep-darks divide the freely-handled figures of the foreground. As algebra is to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Classical arithmetic and Western analysis, so is the cupola-church to the Doric
temple and the Gothic cathedral. It is not as though Diophantus were one of
the great mathematicians. On the contrary, much of what we have been
accustomed to associate with his name is not his work alone. His accidental
importance lies in the fact that, so far as our knowledge goes, he was the first
mathematician in whom the new number-feeling is unmistakably present. In
comparison with the masters who <em>conclude</em> the development of a mathematic—with
Apollonius and Archimedes, with Gauss, Cauchy, Riemann—Diophantus
has, in his form-language especially, something <em>primitive</em>. This something,
which till now we have been pleased to refer to “late-Classical” decadence,
we shall presently learn to understand and value, just as we are revising our
ideas as to the despised “late-Classical” art and beginning to see in it the
tentative expression of the nascent Early Arabian Culture. Similarly archaic,
primitive, and groping was the mathematic of Nicolas Oresme, Bishop of
Lisieux (1323-1382),<a id='r60'></a><a href='#f60' class='c019'><sup>[60]</sup></a> who was the first Western who used co-ordinates so to
say elastically<a id='r61'></a><a href='#f61' class='c019'><sup>[61]</sup></a> and, more important still, to employ fractional powers—both
of which presuppose a number-feeling, obscure it may be but quite unmistakable,
which is completely non-Classical and <em>also</em> non-Arabic. But if, further,
we think of Diophantus together with the early-Christian sarcophagi of the
Roman collections, and of Oresme together with the Gothic wall-statuary of
the German cathedrals, we see that the mathematicians as well as the artists
have something in common, which is, that they stand in their respective Cultures
at <em>the same</em> (viz., the primitive) level of abstract understanding. In the
world and age of Diophantus the stereometric sense of bounds, which had long
ago reached in Archimedes the last stages of refinement and elegance proper to
the megalopolitan intelligence, had passed away. Throughout that world men
were unclear, longing, mystic, and no longer bright and free in the Attic way;
they were men rooted in the earth of a young country-side, not megalopolitans
like Euclid and D’Alembert.<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c019'><sup>[62]</sup></a> They no longer understood the deep and complicated
forms of the Classical thought, and their own were confused and new,
far as yet from urban clarity and tidiness. Their Culture was in the <em>Gothic</em>
condition, as all Cultures have been in their youth—as even the Classical was
in the early Doric period which is known to us now only by its Dipylon pottery.
Only in Baghdad and in the 9th and 10th Centuries were the young ideas of the
age of Diophantus carried through to completion by ripe masters of the calibre
of Plato and Gauss.</p>

<p class='c018'>The decisive act of Descartes, whose geometry appeared in 1637, consisted
not in the introduction of a new method or idea in the domain of traditional
geometry (as we are so frequently told), but in the definitive conception of <em>a
new number-idea</em>, which conception was expressed in the emancipation of geometry
from servitude to optically-realizable constructions and to measured
and measurable lines generally. With that, the analysis of the infinite became
a fact. The rigid, so-called Cartesian, system of co-ordinates—a semi-Euclidean
method of ideally representing measurable magnitudes—had long been
known (witness Oresme) and regarded as of high importance, and when we
get to the bottom of Descartes’ thought we find that what he did was not to
round off the system but to overcome it. Its last historic representative was
Descartes’ contemporary Fermat.<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c019'><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>In place of the sensuous element of concrete lines and planes—the specific
character of the Classical feeling of bounds—there emerged the abstract,
spatial, un-Classical element of the <em>point</em> which from then on was regarded as a
group of co-ordered pure numbers. The idea of magnitude and of perceivable
dimension derived from Classical texts and Arabian traditions was destroyed
and replaced by that of variable relation-values between positions in space.
It is not in general realized that this amounted to the <em>supersession of geometry</em>,
which thenceforward enjoyed only a fictitious existence behind a façade of
Classical tradition. The word “geometry” has an inextensible Apollinian
meaning, and from the time of Descartes what is called the “new geometry”
is made up in part of synthetic work upon the <em>position</em> of <em>points</em> in a space which
is no longer necessarily three-dimensional (a “manifold of points”), and in
part of analysis, in which numbers are defined through point-positions in space.
And this replacement of lengths by positions carries with it a purely spatial,
and no longer a material, conception of extension.</p>

<p class='c001'>The clearest example of this destruction of the inherited optical-finite
geometry seems to me to be the conversion of angular functions—which in
the Indian mathematic had been numbers (in a sense of the word that is hardly
accessible to our minds)—into <em>periodic</em> functions, and their passage thence
into an infinite number-realm, in which they become series and not the
smallest trace remains of the Euclidean figure. In all parts of that realm
the circle-number π, like the Napierian base ε, generates relations of all
sorts which obliterate all the old distinctions of geometry, trigonometry and
algebra, which are neither arithmetical nor geometrical in their nature, and
in which no one any longer dreams of actually drawing circles or working out
powers.</p>

<p class='c018'>At the moment exactly corresponding to that at which (c. 540) the Classical
Soul in the person of Pythagoras discovered its own proper Apollinian number,
the measurable magnitude, the Western soul in the persons of Descartes and his
generation (Pascal, Fermat, Desargues) discovered a notion of number that was
the child of a passionate <em>Faustian</em> tendency towards the infinite. Number as
<em>pure magnitude</em> inherent in the material presentness of things is paralleled by
numbers as <em>pure relation</em>,<a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c019'><sup>[64]</sup></a> and if we may characterize the Classical “world,”
the cosmos, as being based on a deep need of visible limits and composed accordingly
as a sum of material things, so we may say that our world-picture
is an actualizing of an infinite space in which things visible appear very nearly
as realities of a lower order, limited in the presence of the illimitable. The
symbol of the West is an idea of which no other Culture gives even a hint, the
idea of <em>Function</em>. The function is anything rather than an expansion of, it is
complete emancipation from, any pre-existent idea of number. With the function,
not only the Euclidean geometry (and with it the common human geometry
of children and laymen, based on everyday experience) but also the
Archimedean arithmetic, ceased to have any value for the really <em>significant</em>
mathematic of Western Europe. Henceforward, this consisted solely in abstract
analysis. For Classical man geometry and arithmetic were self-contained and
complete sciences of the highest rank, both phenomenal and both concerned
with magnitudes that could be drawn or numbered. For us, on the contrary,
those things are only practical auxiliaries of daily life. Addition and multiplication,
the two Classical methods of reckoning magnitudes, have, like their
sister geometrical-drawing, utterly vanished in the infinity of functional
processes. Even the power, which in the beginning denotes numerically a set
of multiplications (products of equal magnitudes), is, through the exponential
idea (logarithm) and its employment in complex, negative and fractional forms,
dissociated from all connexion with magnitude and transferred to a transcendent
relational world which the Greeks, knowing only the two positive whole-number
powers that represent areas and volumes, were unable to approach.
Think, for instance, of expressions like ε<sup>-x</sup>, <sup>π</sup>√x, α<sup>1⁄i</sup>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every one of the significant creations which succeeded one another so
rapidly from the Renaissance onward—imaginary and complex numbers, introduced
by Cardanus as early as 1550; infinite series, established theoretically
by Newton’s great discovery of the binomial theorem in 1666; the differential
geometry, the definite integral of Leibniz; the aggregate as a new number-unit,
hinted at even by Descartes; new processes like those of general integrals; the
expansion of functions into series and even into infinite series of other functions—is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>a victory over the popular and sensuous number-feeling in us, a victory
which the new mathematic had to win in order to make the new world-feeling
actual.</p>

<p class='c001'>In all history, so far, there is no second example of one Culture paying to
another Culture long extinguished such reverence and submission in matters
of science as ours has paid to the Classical. It was very long before we found
courage to think our proper thought. But though the wish to emulate the
Classical was constantly present, every step of the attempt took us in reality
further away from the imagined ideal. The history of Western knowledge is
thus one of <em>progressive emancipation</em> from Classical thought, an emancipation
never willed but enforced in the depths of the unconscious. <em>And so the development
of the new mathematic consists of a long, secret and finally victorious battle against
the notion of magnitude.</em><a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c019'><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c016'>X</h3>

<p class='c018'>One result of this Classicizing tendency has been to prevent us from finding
the new notation proper to our Western number as such. The present-day sign-language
of mathematics perverts its real content. It is principally owing to
that tendency that the belief in numbers as magnitudes still rules to-day even
amongst mathematicians, for is it not the base of all our written notation?</p>

<p class='c001'>But it is not the separate signs (e.g., χ, π, ς) serving to express the functions
<em>but the function itself as unit</em>, as element, the variable relation no longer
capable of being optically defined, that constitutes the new number; and this
new number should have demanded a new notation built up with entire disregard
of Classical influences. Consider the difference between two equations
(if the same word can be used of two such dissimilar things) such as <span class='math'>3<sup>x</sup> + 4<sup>x</sup> = 5<sup>x</sup></span>
and <span class='math'>x<sup>n</sup> + y<sup>n</sup> = z<sup>n</sup></span> (the equation of Fermat’s theorem). The first consists
of several Classical numbers—i.e., magnitudes—but the second is <em>one number</em>
of a different sort, veiled by being written down according to Euclidean-Archimedean
tradition in the identical form of the first. In the first case, the
sign = establishes a rigid connexion between definite and tangible magnitudes,
but in the second it states that within a domain of variable images there exists
a relation such that from certain alterations certain other alterations necessarily
follow. The first equation has as its aim the specification by measurement of
a concrete magnitude, viz., a “result,” while the second has, in general, no
result but is simply the picture and sign of a relation which for <span class='math'>n>2</span> (this is
the famous Fermat problem<a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c019'><sup>[66]</sup></a>) <em>can probably be shown to</em> exclude integers. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Greek mathematician would have found it quite impossible to understand the
purport of an operation like this, which was not meant to be “worked out.”</p>

<p class='c001'>As applied to the letters in Fermat’s equation, the notion of the unknown
is completely misleading. In the first equation <i>x</i> is a magnitude, defined and
measurable, which it is our business to compute. In the second, the word
“defined” has no meaning at all for <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, <i>n</i>, and consequently we do not
attempt to compute their “values.” Hence they are not numbers at all in the
plastic sense but signs representing a connexion that is destitute of the hallmarks
of magnitude, shape and unique meaning, an infinity of possible positions
of like character, an ensemble unified and so attaining existence as a <em>number</em>.
The whole equation, though written in our unfortunate notation as a plurality
of terms, is actually <em>one single</em> number, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i> being no more numbers than
+ and = are.</p>

<p class='c001'>In fact, directly the essentially anti-Hellenic idea of the irrationals is
introduced, the foundations of the idea of number as concrete and definite
collapse. Thenceforward, the series of such numbers is no longer a visible row
of increasing, discrete, numbers capable of plastic embodiment but a unidimensional
<span lang="la"><i>continuum</i></span> in which each “cut” (in Dedekind’s sense) represents
a number. Such a number is already difficult to reconcile with Classical number,
for the Classical mathematic knows only <em>one</em> number between 1 and 3, whereas
for the Western the totality of such numbers is an infinite aggregate. But when
we introduce further the imaginary (√-1 or <i>i</i>) and finally the complex
numbers (general form <i>a</i> + <i>bi</i>), the linear continuum is broadened into the
highly transcendent form of a number-body, i.e., the content of an aggregate
of homogeneous elements in which a “cut” now stands for a number-surface
containing an infinite aggregate of numbers of a lower “potency” (for instance,
all the real numbers), and there remains not a trace of number in the Classical
and popular sense. These number-surfaces, which since Cauchy and Riemann
have played an important part in the theory of functions, are <em>pure thought-pictures</em>.
Even positive irrational number (e.g., √2) could be conceived in a
sort of negative fashion by Classical minds; they had, in fact, enough idea
of it to ban it as ἄῤῥητος and ἄλογος. But expressions of the form <i>x</i> + <i>yi</i>
lie beyond every possibility of comprehension by Classical thought, whereas
it is on the extension of the mathematical laws over the whole region of
the complex numbers, within which these laws remain operative, that we
have built up the function theory which has at last exhibited the Western
mathematic in all purity and unity. Not until that point was reached could
this mathematic be unreservedly brought to bear in the parallel sphere of our
<em>dynamic</em> Western physics; for the Classical mathematic was fitted precisely to
its own stereometric world of individual objects and to <em>static</em> mechanics as
developed from Leucippus to Archimedes.</p>

<p class='c001'>The brilliant period of the Baroque mathematic—the counterpart of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Ionian—lies substantially in the 18th Century and extends from the decisive
discoveries of Newton and Leibniz through Euler, Lagrange, Laplace and
D’Alembert to Gauss. Once this immense creation found wings, its rise was
miraculous. Men hardly dared believe their senses. The age of refined scepticism
witnessed the emergence of one seemingly impossible truth after another.<a id='r67'></a><a href='#f67' class='c019'><sup>[67]</sup></a>
Regarding the theory of the differential coefficient, D’Alembert had to say:
“Go forward, and faith will come to you.” Logic itself seemed to raise objections
and to prove foundations fallacious. But the goal was reached.</p>

<p class='c001'>This century was a very carnival of abstract and immaterial thinking, in
which the great masters of analysis and, with them, Bach, Gluck, Haydn and
Mozart—a small group of rare and deep intellects—revelled in the most
refined discoveries and speculations, from which Goethe and Kant remained
aloof; and in point of content it is exactly paralleled by the ripest century of
the Ionic, the century of Eudoxus and Archytas (440-350) and, we may add, of
Phidias, Polycletus, Alcamenes and the Acropolis buildings—in which the
form-world of Classical mathematic and sculpture displayed the whole fullness
of its possibilities, and so ended.</p>

<p class='c001'>And now for the first time it is possible to comprehend in full the elemental
opposition of the Classical and the Western souls. In the whole panorama of
history, innumerable and intense as historical relations are, we find no two
things so fundamentally alien to one another as these. And it is because extremes
meet—because it may be there is some deep common origin behind
their divergence—that we find in the Western Faustian soul this yearning
effort towards the Apollinian ideal, the only alien ideal which we have loved
and, for its power of intensely living in the pure sensuous present, have envied.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>XI</h4>

<p class='c018'>We have already observed that, like a child, a primitive mankind acquires
(as part of the inward experience that is the birth of the ego) an understanding
of number and <span lang="la"><i>ipso facto</i></span> possession of an external world referred to the ego. As
soon as the primitive’s astonished eye perceives the dawning world of <em>ordered</em> extension,
and the <em>significant</em> emerges in great outlines from the welter of mere impressions,
and the irrevocable parting of the outer world from his proper, his inner,
world gives form and direction to his waking life, there arises in the soul—instantly
conscious of its loneliness—the root-feeling of <em>longing</em> (Sehnsucht).
It is this that urges “becoming” towards its goal, that motives the fulfilment
and actualizing of every inward possibility, that unfolds the idea of individual
being. It is the child’s longing, which will presently come into the
consciousness more and more clearly as a feeling of constant <em>direction</em> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>finally stand before the mature spirit as the <em>enigma of Time</em>—queer, tempting,
insoluble. Suddenly, the words “past” and “future” have acquired a fateful
meaning.</p>

<p class='c001'>But this longing which wells out of the bliss of the inner life is also, in
the intimate essence of every soul, a <em>dread</em> as well. As all becoming moves
towards a having-become wherein it <em>ends</em>, so the prime feeling of becoming—the
longing—touches the prime feeling of having-become, the dread. In the
present we feel a trickling-away, the past implies a passing. Here is the root
of our eternal dread of the irrevocable, the attained, the final—our dread of
mortality, of the world itself as a thing-become, where death is set as a frontier
like birth—our dread in the moment when the possible is actualized, the life
is inwardly fulfilled and consciousness stands at its <em>goal</em>. It is the deep world-fear
of the child—which never leaves the higher man, the believer, the poet, the
artist—that makes him so infinitely lonely in the presence of the alien powers
that loom, threatening in the dawn, behind the screen of sense-phenomena.
The element of direction, too, which is inherent in all “becoming,” is felt
owing to its inexorable <em>irreversibility</em> to be something alien and hostile, and the
human will-to-understanding ever seeks to bind the inscrutable by the spell
of a name. It is something beyond comprehension, this transformation of
future into past, and thus time, in its contrast with space, has always a queer,
baffling, oppressive ambiguity from which no serious man can wholly protect
himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>This world-fear is assuredly the most <em>creative</em> of all prime feelings. Man owes
to it the ripest and deepest forms and images, not only of his conscious inward
life, but also of the infinitely-varied external culture which reflects this life.
Like a secret melody that not every ear can perceive, it runs through the form-language
of every true art-work, every inward philosophy, every important
deed, and, although those who can perceive it in that domain are the very few,
it lies at the root of the great problems of mathematics. Only the spiritually
dead man of the autumnal cities—Hammurabi’s Babylon, Ptolemaic Alexandria,
Islamic Baghdad, Paris and Berlin to-day—only the pure intellectual,
the sophist, the sensualist, the Darwinian, loses it or is able to evade it by
setting up a secretless “scientific world-view” between himself and the alien.
As the longing attaches itself to that impalpable something whose thousand-formed
elusive manifestations are comprised in, rather than denoted by, the
word “time,” so the other prime feeling, dread, finds its expression in the
intellectual, understandable, outlinable symbols of <em>extension</em>; and thus we find
that every Culture is aware (each in its own special way) of an opposition of
time and space, of direction and extension, the former underlying the latter as
becoming precedes having-become. It is the longing that underlies the dread,
<em>becomes</em> the dread, and not vice versa. The one is not subject to the intellect,
the other is its servant. The rôle of the one is purely to experience, that of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>other purely to know (erleben, erkennen). In the Christian language, the
opposition of the two world-feelings is expressed by: “Fear God and love
Him.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In the soul of all primitive mankind, just as in that of earliest childhood,
there is something which impels it to find means of dealing with the alien
powers of the extension-world that assert themselves, inexorable, in and
through space. To bind, to bridle, to placate, to “know” are all, in the last
analysis, the same thing. In the mysticism of all primitive periods, to <em>know
God</em> means to conjure him, to make him favourable, to <em>appropriate</em> him inwardly.
This is achieved, principally, by means of a word, the Name—the “nomen”
which designates and <em>calls up</em> the “numen”—and also by ritual practices of
secret potency; and the subtlest, as well as the most powerful, form of this
defence is causal and systematic knowledge, delimitation by label and number.
In this respect man only becomes wholly man when he has acquired <em>language</em>.
When cognition has ripened to the point of words, the original chaos of <em>impressions</em>
necessarily transforms itself into a “Nature” that has laws and must
obey them, and the world-in-itself becomes a world-for-us.<a id='r68'></a><a href='#f68' class='c019'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The world-fear is stilled when an intellectual form-language hammers out
brazen vessels in which the mysterious is captured and made comprehensible.
This is the <em>idea</em> of “<em>taboo</em>,”<a id='r69'></a><a href='#f69' class='c019'><sup>[69]</sup></a> which plays a decisive part in the spiritual life of
all primitive men, though the original content of the word lies so far from us
that it is incapable of translation into any ripe culture-language. Blind terror,
religious awe, deep loneliness, melancholy, hate, obscure impulses to draw near,
to be merged, to escape—all those <em>formed</em> feelings of mature souls are in the
childish condition blurred in a monotonous indecision. The two senses of the
word “conjure” (verschwören), meaning to bind and to implore at once, may
serve to make clear the sense of the mystical process by which for primitive
man the formidable alien becomes “taboo.” Reverent awe before that which
is independent of one’s self, things ordained and fixed by law, the alien powers
of the world, is the source from which the elementary formative acts, one and
all, spring. In early times this feeling is actualized in ornament, in laborious
ceremonies and rites, and the rigid laws of primitive intercourse. At the zeniths
of the great Cultures those formations, though retaining inwardly the mark of
their origin, the characteristic of binding and conjuring, have become the
complete form-worlds of the various arts and of religious, scientific and, above
all, <em>mathematical</em> thought. The method common to all—the only way of
actualizing itself that the soul knows—is the <em>symbolizing of extension</em>, of space
or of things; and we find it alike in the conceptions of absolute space that pervade
Newtonian physics, Gothic cathedral-interiors and Moorish mosques, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>the atmospheric infinity of Rembrandt’s paintings and again the dark tone-worlds
of Beethoven’s quartets; in the regular polyhedrons of Euclid, the
Parthenon sculptures and the pyramids of Old Egypt, the Nirvana of Buddha,
the aloofness of court-customs under Sesostris, Justinian I and Louis XIV, in
the God-idea of an Æschylus, a Plotinus, a Dante; and in the world-embracing
spatial energy of modern technics.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>XII</h3>

<p class='c018'>To return to mathematics. In the Classical world the starting-point of
every formative act was, as we have seen, the ordering of the “become,” in so
far as this was present, visible, measurable and numerable. The Western,
Gothic, form-feeling on the contrary is that of an unrestrained, strong-willed
far-ranging soul, and its chosen badge is pure, imperceptible, unlimited space.
But we must not be led into regarding such symbols as unconditional. On the
contrary, they are strictly conditional, though apt to be taken as having identical
essence and validity. Our universe of infinite space, whose existence, for
us, goes without saying, simply does not exist for Classical man. It is not even
capable of being presented to him. On the other hand, the Hellenic cosmos,
which is (as we might have discovered long ago) entirely foreign to our way
of thinking, was for the Hellene something self-evident. The fact is that the
infinite space of our physics is a form of very numerous and extremely complicated
elements tacitly assumed, which have come into being only as the
copy and expression of <em>our</em> soul, and are actual, necessary and natural only for
<em>our</em> type of waking life. The simple notions are always the most difficult. They
are simple, in that they comprise a vast deal that not only is incapable of being
exhibited in words but does not even need to be stated, because <em>for men of the
particular group</em> it is anchored in the intuition; and they are difficult because for
all alien men their real content is <em>ipso facto</em> quite inaccessible. Such a notion,
at once simple and difficult, is our specifically Western meaning of the word
“space.” The whole of our mathematic from Descartes onward is devoted to
the theoretical interpretation of this great and wholly religious symbol. The
aim of all our physics since Galileo is identical; but in the Classical mathematics
and physics the content of this word is simply <em>not known</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here, too, Classical names, inherited from the literature of Greece and
retained in use, have veiled the realities. Geometry means the art of measuring,
arithmetic the art of numbering. The mathematic of the West has long ceased
to have anything to do with both these forms of defining, but it has not managed
to find new names for its own elements—for the word “analysis” is
hopelessly inadequate.</p>

<p class='c001'>The beginning and end of the Classical mathematic is consideration of the
properties of individual bodies and their boundary-surfaces; thus indirectly
taking in conic sections and higher curves. <em>We</em>, on the other hand, at bottom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>know only the abstract space-element of the point, which can neither be seen,
nor measured, nor yet named, but represents simply a centre of reference. The
straight line, for the Greeks a measurable edge, is for us an infinite continuum
of points. Leibniz illustrates his infinitesimal principle by presenting the
straight line as one limiting case and the point as the other limiting case of a
circle having infinitely great or infinitely little radius. But for the Greek the
circle is a <em>plane</em> and the problem that interested him was that of bringing it
into a commensurable condition. Thus the <em>squaring of the circle became for the
Classical intellect the supreme problem of the finite</em>. The deepest problem of world-form
seemed to it to be to alter surfaces bounded by curved lines, without
change of magnitude, into rectangles and so to render them measureable. For
us, on the other hand, it has become the usual, and not specially significant,
practice to represent the number π by algebraic means, regardless of any geometrical
image.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Classical mathematician knows only what he sees and grasps. Where
definite and defining visibility—the domain of his thought—ceases, his science
comes to an end. The Western mathematician, as soon as he has quite shaken off
the trammels of Classical prejudice, goes off into a wholly abstract region of
infinitely numerous “manifolds” of <i>n</i> (no longer 3) dimensions, in which his
so-called geometry always can and generally must do without every commonplace
aid. When Classical man turns to artistic expressions of his form-feeling,
he tries with marble and bronze to give the dancing or the wrestling human
form that pose and attitude in which surfaces and contours have all attainable
proportion and meaning. But the true artist of the West shuts his eyes and
loses himself in the realm of bodiless music, in which harmony and polyphony
bring him to images of utter “beyondness” that transcend all possibilities of
visual definition. One need only think of the meanings of the word “figure”
as used respectively by the Greek sculptor and the Northern contrapuntist, and
the opposition of the two worlds, the two mathematics, is immediately presented.
The Greek <a id='corr82.30'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='methematicians'>mathematicians</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_82.30'>mathematicians</a></span> ever use the word σῶμα for their entities,
just as the Greek lawyers used it for persons as distinct from things (σώματα
καὶ πράγματα: <span lang="la"><i>personæ et res</i></span>).</p>

<p class='c001'>Classical number, integral and corporeal, therefore inevitably seeks to relate
itself with the birth of bodily man, the σῶμα. The number 1 is hardly yet
conceived of as actual number but rather as ἀρχή, the prime stuff of the
number-series, the origin of all true numbers and therefore all magnitudes,
measures and materiality (Dinglichkeit). In the group of the Pythagoreans
(the date does not matter) its figured-sign was also the symbol of the mother-womb,
the origin of all life. The digit 2, the first <em>true</em> number, which doubles
the 1, was therefore correlated with the male principle and given the sign of
the phallus. And, finally, 3, the “holy number” of the Pythagoreans, denoted
the act of union between man and woman, the act of propagation—the erotic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>suggestion in adding and multiplying (the only two processes of increasing, of
<em>propagating</em>, magnitude useful to Classical man) is easily seen—and its sign was
the combination of the two first. Now, all this throws quite a new light upon
the legends previously alluded to, concerning the sacrilege of disclosing the
irrational. The irrational—in our language the employment of unending
decimal fractions—implied the destruction of an organic and corporeal and
reproductive order that the gods had laid down. There is no doubt that the
Pythagorean reforms of the Classical religion were themselves based upon the
immemorial Demeter-cult. Demeter, Gæa, is akin to Mother Earth. There is
a deep relation between the honour paid to her and this exalted conception of
the numbers.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus, inevitably, the Classical became by degrees the Culture of the <em>small</em>.
The Apollinian soul had tried to tie down the meaning of things-become
by means of the principle of <em>visible limits</em>; its taboo was focused upon the
immediately-present and proximate alien. What was far away, invisible, was
<span lang="la"><i>ipso facto</i></span> “not there.” The Greek and the Roman alike sacrificed to the gods of
the place in which he happened to stay or reside; all other deities were outside
the range of vision. Just as the Greek tongue—again and again we shall note
the mighty symbolism of such language-phenomena—possessed <em>no word for
space</em>, so the Greek himself was destitute of our feeling of landscape, horizons,
outlooks, distances, clouds, and of the idea of the far-spread fatherland embracing
the great nation. <em>Home</em>, for Classical man, is what he can see from the
citadel of his native town and no more. All that lay beyond the visual range
of this political atom was alien, and hostile to boot; beyond that narrow range,
fear set in at once, and hence the appalling bitterness with which these petty
towns strove to destroy one another. The Polis is the smallest of all conceivable
state-forms, and its policy is frankly short-range, therein differing in the
extreme from our own cabinet-diplomacy which is the policy of the unlimited.
Similarly, the Classical temple, which can be taken in in one glance, is the
smallest of all first-rate architectural forms. Classical geometry from Archytas
to Euclid—like the school geometry of to-day which is still dominated by it—concerned
itself with small, manageable figures and bodies, and therefore
remained unaware of the difficulties that arise in establishing figures of astronomical
dimensions, which in many cases are not amenable to Euclidean geometry.<a id='r70'></a><a href='#f70' class='c019'><sup>[70]</sup></a>
Otherwise the subtle Attic spirit would almost surely have arrived at
some notion of the problems of non-Euclidean geometry, for its criticism of the
well-known “parallel” axiom,<a id='r71'></a><a href='#f71' class='c019'><sup>[71]</sup></a> the doubtfulness of which soon aroused opposition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>yet could not in any way be elucidated, brought it very close indeed to
the decisive discovery. The Classical mind as unquestioningly devoted and
limited itself to the study of the small and the near as ours has to that of the
infinite and ultra-visual. All the mathematical ideas that the West found for
itself or borrowed from others were automatically subjected to the form-language
of the Infinitesimal—and that long before the actual Differential
Calculus was discovered. Arabian algebra, Indian trigonometry, Classical
mechanics were incorporated as a matter of course in analysis. Even the most
“self-evident” propositions of elementary arithmetic such as 2 × 2 = 4 become,
when considered analytically, problems, and the solution of these problems
was only made possible by deductions from the Theory of Aggregates, and
is in many points still unaccomplished. Plato and his age would have looked
upon this sort of thing not only as a hallucination but also as evidence of an
utterly nonmathematical mind. In a certain measure, geometry may be treated
algebraically and algebra geometrically, that is, the eye may be switched off
or it may be allowed to govern. We take the first alternative, the Greeks the
second. Archimedes, in his beautiful management of spirals, touches upon certain
general facts that are also fundamentals in Leibniz’s method of the definite
integral; but his processes, for all their superficial appearance of modernity, are
subordinated to stereometric principles; in like case, an Indian mathematician
would naturally have found some trigonometrical formulation.<a id='r72'></a><a href='#f72' class='c019'><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c016'>XIII</h3>

<p class='c018'>From this fundamental opposition of Classical and Western numbers there
arises an equally radical difference in the relationship of element to element in
each of these number-worlds. The nexus of <em>magnitudes</em> is called <em>proportion</em>, that
of <em>relations</em> is comprised in the notion of <em>function</em>. The significance of these two
words is not confined to mathematics proper; they are of high importance also
in the allied arts of sculpture and music. Quite apart from the rôle of proportion
in ordering the parts of the <em>individual</em> statue, the typically Classical artforms
of the statue, the relief, and the fresco, admit <i>enlargements and reductions of
scale—words that in music have no meaning at all</i>—as we see in the art of the
gems, in which the subjects are essentially reductions from life-sized originals.
In the domain of Function, on the contrary, it is the idea of <em>transformation of
groups</em> that is of decisive importance, and the musician will readily agree that
similar ideas play an essential part in modern composition-theory. I need only
allude to one of the most elegant orchestral forms of the 18th Century, the
<span lang="it"><cite>Tema con Variazioni</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>All proportion assumes the constancy, all transformation the variability of
the constituents. Compare, for instance, the congruence theorems of Euclid,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>the proof of which depends in fact on the assumed ratio 1 : 1, with the modern
deduction of the same by means of angular functions.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>XIV</h4>

<p class='c018'>The Alpha and Omega of the Classical mathematic is <em>construction</em> (which in
the broad sense includes elementary arithmetic), that is, the production of a
single visually-present figure. The chisel, in this second sculptural art, is the
compass. On the other hand, in function-research, where the object is not a
result of the magnitude sort but a discussion of general formal possibilities, the
way of working is best described as a sort of composition-procedure closely
analogous to the musical; and in fact, a great number of the ideas met with in
the theory of music (key, phrasing, chromatics, for instance) can be directly
employed in physics, and it is at least arguable that many relations would be
clarified by so doing.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every <em>construction</em> affirms, and every <em>operation</em> denies appearances, in that the
one works out that which is optically given and the other dissolves it. And so
we meet with yet another contrast between the two kinds of mathematic; the
Classical mathematic of small things deals with the concrete <em>individual instance</em>
and produces a once-for-all construction, while the mathematic of the infinite
handles whole <em>classes</em> of formal possibilities, <em>groups</em> of functions, operations,
equations, curves, and does so with an eye, not to any result they may have,
but to their course. And so for the last two centuries—though present-day
mathematicians hardly realize the fact—there has been growing up <em>the idea of
a general morphology of mathematical operations</em>, which we are justified in regarding
as the real meaning of modern mathematics as a whole. All this, as we shall
perceive more and more clearly, is one of the manifestations of a general tendency
inherent in the Western intellect, proper to the Faustian spirit and
Culture and found in no other. The great majority of the problems which
occupy our mathematic, and are regarded as “our” problems in the same sense
as the squaring of the circle was the Greeks’,—e.g., the investigation of convergence
in infinite series (Cauchy) and the transformation of elliptic and
algebraic integrals into multiply-periodic functions (Abel, Gauss)—would
probably have seemed to the Ancients, who strove for simple and definite
quantitative results, to be an exhibition of rather abstruse virtuosity. And
so indeed the popular mind regards them even to-day. There is nothing
less “popular” than the modern mathematic, and it too contains its symbolism
of the infinitely far, of <em>distance</em>. <em>All</em> the great works of the West,
from the “Divina Commedia” to “Parsifal,” are unpopular, whereas everything
Classical from Homer to the Altar of Pergamum was popular in the
highest degree.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>
  <h4 class='c021'>XV</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Thus, finally, the whole content of Western number-thought centres itself
upon the historic <em>limit-problem</em> of the Faustian mathematic, the key which opens
the way to the Infinite, that <em>Faustian infinite</em> which is so different from the
infinity of Arabian and Indian world-ideas. Whatever the guise—infinite
series, curves or functions—in which number appears in the particular case,
the <em>essence</em> of it is the <em>theory of the limit</em>.<a id='r73'></a><a href='#f73' class='c019'><sup>[73]</sup></a> This limit is the absolute opposite of
the limit which (without being so called) figures in the Classical problem of
the quadrature of the circle. Right into the 18th Century, Euclidean popular
prepossessions obscured the real meaning of the differential principle. The idea
of infinitely small quantities lay, so to say, ready to hand, and however skilfully
they were handled, there was bound to remain a trace of the Classical
constancy, the <em>semblance of magnitude</em>, about them, though Euclid would never
have known them or admitted them as such. Thus, zero is a constant, a whole
number in the linear continuum between +1 and -1; and it was a great hindrance
to Euler in his analytical researches that, like many after him, he treated the
differentials as zero. Only in the 19th Century was this relic of Classical
number-feeling finally removed and the Infinitesimal Calculus made logically
secure by Cauchy’s definitive elucidation of the <em>limit-idea</em>; only the intellectual
step from the “infinitely small quantity” to the “lower limit of <em>every possible</em>
finite magnitude” brought out the conception of a variable number which
oscillates beneath any assignable number that is not zero. A number of this
sort has ceased to possess any character of magnitude whatever: the limit, as
thus finally presented by theory, is no longer that which is approximated to,
but <em>the approximation, the process, the operation itself. It is not a state, but a relation.</em>
And so in this decisive problem of our mathematic, we are suddenly made to
see how <em>historical</em> is the constitution of the Western soul.<a id='r74'></a><a href='#f74' class='c019'><sup>[74]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c016'>XVI</h3>

<p class='c018'>The liberation of geometry from the visual, and of algebra from the notion
of magnitude, and the union of both, beyond all elementary limitations of
drawing and counting, in the great structure of function-theory—this was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>grand course of Western number-thought. The constant number of the Classical
mathematic was dissolved into the variable. Geometry <i>became</i> analytical and
dissolved all concrete forms, replacing the mathematical bodies from which the
rigid geometrical values had been obtained, by abstract spatial relations which
in the end ceased to have any application at all to sense-present phenomena.
It began by substituting for Euclid’s optical figures geometrical loci referred to a
co-ordinate system of arbitrarily chosen “origin,” and reducing the postulated
objectiveness of existence of the geometrical object to the one condition that
during the operation (which itself was one of equating and not of measurement)
the selected co-ordinate system should not be changed. But these co-ordinates
immediately came to be regarded as values pure and simple, serving not so much
to determine as to represent and replace the position of points as space-elements.
Number, the boundary of things-become, was represented, not as before pictorially
by a figure, but symbolically by an equation. “Geometry” altered its meaning;
the co-ordinate system as a picturing disappeared and the point became an
entirely abstract number-group. In architecture, we find this inward transformation
of Renaissance into Baroque through the innovations of Michael Angelo
and Vignola. Visually pure lines became, in palace and church façades as in
mathematics, ineffectual. In place of the clear co-ordinates that we have in
Romano-Florentine colonnading and storeying, the “infinitesimal” appears in
the graceful flow of elements, the scrollwork, the cartouches. The constructive
dissolves in the wealth of the decorative—in mathematical language, the
functional. Columns and pilasters, assembled in groups and clusters, break up
the façades, gather and disperse again restlessly. The flat surfaces of wall, roof,
storey melt into a wealth of stucco work and ornaments, vanish and break into
a play of light and shade. The light itself, as it is made to play upon the form-world
of mature Baroque—viz., the period from Bernini (1650) to the Rococo
of Dresden, Vienna and Paris—has become an essentially musical element.
The Dresden Zwinger<a id='r75'></a><a href='#f75' class='c019'><sup>[75]</sup></a> is a <span lang="it"><i>sinfonia</i></span>. Along with 18th Century mathematics,
18th Century architecture develops into a form-world of <em>musical</em> characters.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>XVII</h3>

<p class='c018'>This mathematics of ours was bound in due course to reach the point at
which not merely the limits of artificial geometrical form but the limits of the
visual itself were felt by theory and by the soul alike as limits indeed, as obstacles
to the unreserved expression of inward possibilities—in other words,
the point at which the ideal of transcendent extension came into fundamental
conflict with the limitations of immediate perception. The Classical soul, with
the entire abdication of Platonic and Stoic ἀταραξία, submitted to the sensuous
and (as the erotic under-meaning of the Pythagorean numbers shows) it rather
<em>felt</em> than <em>emitted</em> its great symbols. Of transcending the corporeal here-and-now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>it was quite incapable. But whereas number, as conceived by a Pythagorean,
exhibited the essence of individual and discrete <em>data</em> in “Nature” Descartes
and his successors looked upon number as <em>something to be conquered</em>, to be
<em>wrung out</em>, an abstract relation royally indifferent to all phenomenal support
and capable of holding its own against “Nature” on all occasions. The
will-to-power (to use Nietzsche’s great formula) that from the earliest Gothic
of the Eddas, the Cathedrals and Crusades, and even from the old conquering
Goths and Vikings, has distinguished the attitude of the Northern
soul to its world, appears also in the sense-transcending energy, the <em>dynamic</em>
of Western number. In the Apollinian mathematic the intellect is the servant
of the eye, in the Faustian its master. Mathematical, “absolute” space,
we see then, is utterly un-Classical, and from the first, although mathematicians
with their reverence for the Hellenic tradition did not dare to observe the fact,
it was something different from the indefinite spaciousness of daily experience
and customary painting, the <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> space of Kant which seemed so unambiguous
and sure a concept. It is a pure abstract, an ideal and unfulfillable postulate
of a soul which is ever less and less satisfied with sensuous means of expression
and in the end passionately brushes them aside. <em>The inner eye has awakened.</em></p>

<p class='c001'>And then, for the first time, those who thought deeply were obliged to
see that the Euclidean geometry, which is the <em>true and only</em> geometry of the
simple of all ages, is when regarded from the higher standpoint nothing but a
<em>hypothesis</em>, the general validity of which, since Gauss, we know it to be quite
impossible to prove in the face of other and perfectly non-perceptual geometries.
The critical proposition of this geometry, Euclid’s axiom of parallels, is an
<em>assertion</em>, for which we are quite at liberty to substitute another assertion. We
may assert, in fact, that through a given point, no parallels, or two, or many
parallels may be drawn to a given straight line, and all these assumptions lead
to completely irreproachable geometries of three dimensions, which can be
employed in physics and even in astronomy, and are in some cases preferable to
the Euclidean.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even the simple axiom that extension is boundless (boundlessness, since
Riemann and the theory of curved space, is to be distinguished from endlessness)
at once contradicts the essential character of all immediate perception, in that
the latter depends upon the existence of light-resistances and <span lang="la"><i>ipso facto</i></span> has
material bounds. But abstract principles of boundary can be imagined which
transcend, in an entirely new sense, the possibilities of optical definition. For
the deep thinker, there exists even in the Cartesian geometry the tendency to
get beyond the three dimensions of <em>experiential</em> space, regarded as an unnecessary
restriction on the symbolism of number. And although it was not till about
1800 that the notion of <em>multi-dimensional space</em> (it is a pity that no better word
was found) provided analysis with broader foundations, the real first step was
taken at the moment when powers—that is, really, logarithms—were released
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>from their original relation with sensually realizable surfaces and solids
and, through the employment of irrational and complex exponents, brought
within the realm of function as perfectly general relation-values. It will be
admitted by everyone who understands anything of mathematical reasoning
that directly we passed from the notion of a³ as a natural maximum to that
of a<sup><i>n</i></sup>, the unconditional necessity of three-dimensional space was done away
with.</p>

<p class='c001'>Once the space-element or point had lost its last persistent relic of visualness
and, instead of being represented to the eye as a cut in co-ordinate lines, was
defined as a group of three independent numbers, there was no longer any
inherent objection to replacing the number 3 by the general number <i>n</i>. The
notion of dimension was radically changed. It was no longer a matter of
treating the properties of a point metrically with reference to its position in a
visible system, but of representing the entirely abstract properties of a number-group
by means of any dimensions that we please. The number-group—consisting
of <i>n</i> independent ordered elements—is an <em>image</em> of the point and it is
<em>called</em> a point. Similarly, an equation logically arrived therefrom is <em>called</em> a
plane and is the image of a plane. And the aggregate of all points of <i>n</i> dimensions
is <em>called</em> an <i>n</i>-dimensional space.<a id='r76'></a><a href='#f76' class='c019'><sup>[76]</sup></a> In these transcendent space-worlds,
which are remote from every sort of sensualism, lie the relations which it is the
business of analysis to investigate and which are found to be consistently in
agreement with the data of experimental physics. This space of higher degree
is a symbol which is through-and-through the peculiar property of the Western
mind. That mind alone has attempted, and successfully too, to capture the
“become” and the extended in <em>these</em> forms, to conjure and bind—to “know”—the
alien by <em>this</em> kind of appropriation or taboo. Not until such spheres
of number-thought are reached, and not for any men but the few who have
reached them, do such imaginings as systems of hypercomplex numbers (e.g.,
the quaternions of the calculus of vectors) and apparently quite meaningless
symbols like ∞<sup><i>n</i></sup> acquire the character of something actual. And here if anywhere
it must be understood that actuality is not only sensual actuality. The
spiritual is in no wise limited to perception-forms for the actualizing of its idea.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>XVIII</h3>

<p class='c018'>From this grand intuition of symbolic space-worlds came the last and conclusive
creation of Western mathematic—the expansion and subtilizing of the
function theory in that of <em>groups</em>. Groups are aggregates or sets of homogeneous
mathematical images—e.g., the totality of all differential equations of a certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>type—which in structure and ordering are analogous to the Dedekind
number-bodies. Here are worlds, we feel, of perfectly new numbers, which are
nevertheless not utterly sense-transcendent for the <em>inner</em> eye of the adept; and
the problem now is to discover in those vast abstract form-systems certain
elements which, relatively to a particular group of operations (viz., of transformations
of the system), remain unaffected thereby, that is, possess invariance.
In mathematical language, the problem, as stated generally by Klein, is—given
an <i>n</i>-dimensional manifold (“space”) and a group of transformations, it
is required to examine the forms belonging to the manifold in respect of such
properties as are not altered by transformation of the group.</p>

<p class='c001'>And with this culmination our Western mathematic, having exhausted
every inward possibility and fulfilled its destiny as the <em>copy and purest expression
of the idea of the Faustian soul</em>, closes its development in the same way as the
mathematic of the Classical Culture concluded in the third century. Both those
sciences (the only ones of which the organic structure can even to-day be
examined historically) arose out of a wholly new idea of number, in the one
case Pythagoras’s, in the other Descartes’. Both, expanding in all beauty,
reached their maturity one hundred years later; and both, after flourishing for
three centuries, completed the structure of their ideas at the same moment as the
Cultures to which they respectively belonged passed over into the phase of
megalopolitan Civilization. The deep significance of this interdependence will
be made clear in due course. It is enough for the moment that for us the time
of the <em>great</em> mathematicians is past. Our tasks to-day are those of preserving,
rounding off, refining, selection—in place of big dynamic creation, the same
clever detail-work which characterized the Alexandrian mathematic of late
Hellenism.</p>

<p class='c001'>A historical paradigm will make this clearer.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c016'>I <br> PHYSIOGNOMIC AND SYSTEMATIC</h3>

<h4 class='c026'>I</h4>

<p class='c018'>Now, at last, it is possible to take the decisive step of sketching an image of
history that is independent of the accident of standpoint, of the period in which
this or that observer lives—independent too of the personality of the observer
himself, who as an interested member of his own Culture is tempted, by its
religious, intellectual, political and social tendencies, to order the material of
history according to a perspective that is limited as to both space and time, and
to fashion arbitrary forms into which the superficies of history can be forced
but which are entirely alien to its inner content.</p>

<p class='c001'>What has been missing, till now, is <em>detachment</em> from the objects considered
(die Distanz vom Gegenstande). In respect of Nature, this detachment has
long ago been attained, though of course it was relatively easy of attainment,
since the physicist can obviously systematize the mechanical-causal picture of
his world as impersonally as though he himself did not exist in it.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is quite possible, however, to do the same as regards the form-world of
History. We have merely been unaware of the possibility. The modern historian,
in the very act of priding himself on his “objectivity,” naïvely and
unconsciously reveals his prepossessions. For this reason it is quite legitimate
to say—and it will infallibly be said some day—that so far a genuinely
Faustian treatment of history has been entirely lacking. By such a treatment
is meant one that has enough detachment to admit that any “present” is only
such with reference to a particular generation of men; that the number of generations
is infinite, and that the proper present must therefore be regarded just as
something infinitely distant and alien is regarded, and treated as an interval of
time neither more nor less significant in the whole picture of History than
others. Such a treatment will employ no distorting modulus of personal ideals,
set no personal origin of co-ordinates, be influenced by none of the personal
hopes and fears and other inward impulses which count for so much in practical
life; and such a detachment will—to use the words of Nietzsche (who, be
it said, was far from possessing enough of it himself)—enable one to view
the whole fact of Man from an immense distance, to regard the individual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Cultures, one’s own included, as one regards the range of mountain peaks along
a horizon.</p>

<p class='c001'>Once again, therefore, there was an act like the act of Copernicus to be
accomplished, an act of emancipation from the evident present in the name of
infinity. This the Western soul achieved in the domain of Nature long ago,
when it passed from the Ptolemaic world-system to that which is alone valid for
it to-day, and treats the position of the observer on one particular planet as
accidental instead of normative.</p>

<p class='c001'>A similar emancipation of world-history from the accidental standpoint,
the perpetually re-defined “modern period,” is both possible and necessary.
It is true that the 19th Century <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> seems to us infinitely fuller and more important
than, say, the 19th Century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>; but the moon, too, seems to us bigger
than Jupiter or Saturn. The physicist has long ago freed himself from prepossessions
as to relative distance, the historian not so. We permit ourselves
to consider the Culture of the Greeks as an “ancient” related to our own
“modern.” Were they in their turn “modern” in relation to the finished and
historically mature Egyptians of the court of the great Thuthmosis who lived
a millennium before Homer? For us, the events which took place between 1500
and 1800 on the soil of Western Europe constitute the most important third of
"world"-history; for the Chinese historian, on the contrary, who looks back
on and judges by 4000 years of Chinese history, those centuries generally are a
brief and unimportant episode, infinitely less significant than the centuries of
the Han dynasty (206 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> to 220 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>), which in <em>his</em> "world"-history are
epoch-making.</p>

<p class='c001'>To liberate History, then, from that thraldom to the observers’ prejudices
which in our own case has made of it nothing more than a record of a partial
past leading up to an accidental present, with the ideals and interests of that
present as criteria of the achievement and possibility, is the object of all that
follows.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>II</h4>

<p class='c018'><em>Nature</em> and <em>History</em><a id='r77'></a><a href='#f77' class='c019'><sup>[77]</sup></a> are the opposite extreme terms of man’s range of possibilities,
whereby he is enabled to order the actualities about him as a picture of
the world. An actuality is Nature in so far as it assigns things-becoming their
place as things-become, and History in so far as it orders things-become with
reference to their becoming. An actuality as an evocation of mind is contemplated,
and as an assurance of the senses is critically comprehended, the first
being exemplified in the worlds of Plato, Rembrandt, Goethe and Beethoven,
the second in the worlds of Parmenides, Descartes, Kant and Newton. Cognition
in the strict sense of the word is that act of experience of which the completed
issue is called “Nature.” The cognized and “Nature” are one and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>same. The symbol of mathematical number has shown us that the aggregate of
things cognized is the same as the world of things mechanically defined, things
correct once and for all, things brought under law. <em>Nature is the sum of the law-imposed
necessities.</em> There are only laws of <em>Nature</em>. No physicist who understands
his duty would wish to transcend these limits. His task is to establish
an ordered code which not only includes all the laws that he can find in the
picture of Nature that is proper to himself but, further, represents that picture
exhaustively and without remainder.</p>

<p class='c001'>Contemplation or vision (Anschauen), on the other hand—I may recall
Goethe’s words: “vision is to be carefully distinguished from seeing”—, is that
act of experience which <em>is itself history because it is itself a fulfilling</em>. That which
has been lived is that which has happened, and it is history. (Erlebtes ist
Geschehenes, ist Geschichte.)</p>

<p class='c001'>Every happening is unique and incapable of being repeated. It carries the
hall-mark of Direction (“Time”), of <em>irreversibility</em>. That which has happened
is thenceforth counted with the become and not with the becoming, with the
stiffened and not the living, and belongs beyond recall to the past. Our feeling
of world-fear has its sources here. Everything cognized, on the contrary, is
<em>timeless</em>, neither past nor future but simply “there,” and consequently permanently
valid, as indeed the very constitution of natural law requires that it
should be. Law and the domain of law are <em>anti-historical</em>. They exclude incident
and casuality. The laws of nature are forms of rigorous and therefore
inorganic necessity. It becomes easy to see why mathematics, as the ordering
of things-become by number, is <em>always and exclusively</em> associated with laws and
causality.</p>

<p class='c001'>Becoming has no number. We can count, measure, dissect only the lifeless
and so much of the living as can be dissociated from livingness. Pure becoming,
pure life, is in this sense incapable of being bounded. It lies beyond the domain
of cause and effect, law and measure. No deep and pure historical research
seeks for conformities with causal laws—or, if it does so, it does not understand
its own essence.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the same time, history as positively treated is not pure becoming: it is
an image, a world-form radiated from the waking consciousness of the historian,
in which the becoming <em>dominates</em> the become. The possibility of extracting
results of any sort by scientific methods depends upon the proportion of
things-become present in the subject treated, and by hypothesis there is in this
case a defect of them; the higher the proportion is, the more mechanical, reasonable,
causal, history is made to appear. Even Goethe’s “living nature,” utterly
unmathematical world-picture as it was, contained enough of the dead and
stiffened to allow him to treat at least his foreground scientifically. But when
this content of things-become dwindles to very little, then history becomes
approximately pure becoming, and contemplation and vision become an experience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>which can only be rendered in forms of <em>art</em>. That which Dante saw
before his spiritual eyes as the destiny of the world, he <em>could not possibly</em> have
arrived at by ways of science, any more than Goethe could have attained by
these ways to what he saw in the great moments of his “Faust” studies, any
more than Plotinus and Giordano Bruno could have distilled their visions from
researches. This contrast lies at the root of all dispute regarding the inner form
of history. In the presence of the same object or corpus of facts, every observer
according to his own disposition has a different <em>impression</em> of the whole, and
this impression, <em>intangible and incommunicable</em>, underlies his judgment and gives
it its personal colour. The degree in which things-become are taken in differs
from man to man, which is quite enough in itself to show that they can never
agree as to task or method. Each accuses the other of a deficiency of “clear
thinking,” and yet the something that is expressed by this phrase is something
not built with hands, not implying superiority or a priority of degree
but necessary difference of kind. The same applies to all natural sciences.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nevertheless, we must not lose sight of the fact that at bottom the wish to
write history <em>scientifically</em> involves a contradiction. True science reaches just as
far as the notions of truth and falsity have validity: this applies to mathematics
and it applies also to the science of historical spade-work, viz., the collection,
ordering and sifting of material. But real historical vision (which only <em>begins</em>
at this point) belongs to the domain of significances, in which the crucial words
are not “correct” and “erroneous,” but “deep” and “shallow.” The true
physicist is not deep, but <em>keen</em>: it is only when he leaves the domain of working
hypotheses and brushes against the final things that he can be deep, but at this
stage he is already a metaphysician. Nature is to be handled scientifically,
History poetically. Old Leopold von Ranke is credited with the remark that,
after all, Scott’s “Quentin Durward” was the true history-writing. And so it
is: the advantage of a good history book is that it enables the reader to be his
own Scott.</p>

<p class='c001'>On the other hand, within the very realm of numbers and exact knowledge
there is that which Goethe called “living Nature,” an immediate vision of
pure becoming and self-shaping, in fact, history as above defined. Goethe’s
world was, in the first instance, an organism, an existence, and it is easy therefore
to see why his researches, even when superficially of a physical kind, do
not make numbers, or laws, or causality captured in formulæ, or dissection of
any sort their object, but are morphology in the highest sense of the word; and
why his work neither uses nor needs to use the specifically Western and un-Classical
means of causal treatment, metrical experiment. His treatment of the
Earth’s crust is invariably geology, and never mineralogy, which he called the
science of something dead.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let it be said, once more, that there are no exact boundaries set between the
two kinds of world-notion. However great the contrast between becoming and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>the become, the fact remains that they are jointly present in every kind of
understanding. He who looks at the becoming and fulfilling in them, experiences
History; he who dissects them as become and fulfilled cognizes Nature.</p>

<p class='c001'>In every man, in every Culture, in every culture-phase, there is found an
inherent disposition, an inherent inclination and vocation to prefer one of the
two forms as an ideal of understanding the world. Western man is in a high
degree historically disposed,<a id='r78'></a><a href='#f78' class='c019'><sup>[78]</sup></a> Classical man far from being so. We follow up
what is given us with an eye to past and future, whereas Classical man knew
only the point-present and an ambiance of myth. We have before us a symbol
of becoming in every bar of our music from Palestrina to Wagner, and the
Greeks a symbol of the pure present in every one of their statues. The rhythm
of a body is based upon a simultaneous relation of the parts, that of a fugue in
the succession of elements in time.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>III</h3>

<p class='c018'>There emerge, then, as the two basic elements of all world-picturing, the
principle of Form (Gestalt) and the principle of Law (Gesetz). The more
decidedly a particular world-picture shows the traits of “Nature,” the more
unconditionally law and number prevail in it; and the more purely intuitive
the picture of the world as eternally becoming, the more alien to numbers its
manifold and intangible elements. “Form is something mobile, something
becoming, something passing. The doctrine of formation is the doctrine of
transformation. Metamorphosis is the key to the whole alphabet of Nature,”
so runs a note of Goethe’s, marking already the methodic difference between
his famous “exact percipient fancy” which quietly lets itself be worked upon
by the living,<a id='r79'></a><a href='#f79' class='c019'><sup>[79]</sup></a> and the exact killing procedure of modern physics. But whatever
the process, a remainder consisting of so much of the alien element as is present
is always found. In strict natural sciences this remainder takes the form of the
inevitable <em>theories and hypotheses</em> which are imposed on, and leaven, the stiff mass
of number and formula. In historical research, it appears as <em>chronology</em>, the
number-structure of dates and statistics which, alien though number is to the
essence of becoming, is so thoroughly woven around and into the world of
historical forms that it is never felt to be intrusive. For it is devoid of mathematical
import. Chronological number distinguishes uniquely-occurring actualities,
mathematical number constant possibilities. The one sharpens the
images and works up the outlines of epoch and fact for the understanding eye.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>But the other <em>is itself</em> the law which it seeks to establish, the end and aim of
research. Chronological number is a scientific means of pioneering borrowed
from the science of sciences, mathematics, and used as such without regard to
its specific properties. Compare, for instance, the meaning of the two symbols
12 × 8 = 96, and 18 October, 1813.<a id='r80'></a><a href='#f80' class='c019'><sup>[80]</sup></a> It is the same difference, in the use of
figures, that prose and poetry present in the use of words.</p>

<p class='c001'>One other point remains to be noted.<a id='r81'></a><a href='#f81' class='c019'><sup>[81]</sup></a> As a becoming always lies at the
base of the become, and as the world-picture representative of becoming is that
which history gives us, therefore history is the <em>original</em> world-form, and Nature—the
fully elaborated world-mechanism—is the <em>late</em> world-form that only
the men of a mature Culture can completely actualize. In fact, the darkness
encompassing the simple soul of primitive mankinds, which we can realize even
to-day from their religious customs and myths—that entirely organic world of
pure wilfulness, of hostile demons and kindly powers—was through-and-through
a living and swaying whole, ununderstandable, indefinable, incalculable.
We may call this Nature if we like, but it is not what <em>we</em> mean by
“nature,” i.e., the strict image projected by a knowing intellect. Only the
souls of children and of great artists can now hear the echoes of this long-forgotten
world of nascent humanity, but it echoes still, and not rarely, even
in the inelastic "nature"-medium that the city-spirit of the mature Culture is
remorselessly building up round the individual. Hence that acute antagonism
between the scientific (“modern”) and the artistic (“unpractical”) world-idea
which every Late period knows; the man of fact and the poet do not and
cannot understand one another. Hence comes, too, that tendency of historical
study, which must inevitably contain an element of the childish, the
dreamy, the Goethian, to dress up as a science, to be (using its own naïve
word) “materialistic,” at the imminent risk of becoming a mere physics of
public life.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Nature,” in the exact sense, is a way of possessing actuality which is
special to the few, restricted to the megalopolitans of the late periods of great
Cultures, masculine, perhaps even senatorial; while History is the naïve, youthful,
more or less instinctive way that is proper to <em>all</em> men alike. At least, that
is the position of the number-based, unmystical, dissectable and dissected
“Nature” of Aristotle and Kant, the Sophists and the Darwinians, modern
physics and chemistry, <span lang="la"><i>vis-à-vis</i></span> the lived, felt and unconfined “Nature” of
Homer and the Eddas, of Doric and Gothic man. To overlook this is to miss
the whole essence of historical treatment. It is history that is the truly natural,
and the exact mechanically-correct “Nature” of the scientist that is the
artificial conception of world by soul. Hence the paradox that modern man
finds "nature"-study easy and historical study hard.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Tendencies towards a mechanistic idea of the world proceeding wholly from
mathematical delimitation and logical differentiation, from law and causality,
appear quite early. They are found in the first centuries of all Cultures, still
weak, scattered and lost in the full tide of the religious world-conception. The
name to be recalled here is that of Roger Bacon. But soon these tendencies
acquire a sterner character: like everything that is wrung out of the soul and
has to defend itself against human nature, they are not wanting in arrogance
and exclusiveness. Quietly the spatial and comprehensible (comprehension is
in its essence number, in its structure quantitative) becomes prepotent throughout
the outer world of the individual and, aiding and aided by the simple
impressions of sensuous-life, effects a mechanical synthesis of the causal and
legal sort, so that at long last the sharp consciousness of the megalopolitan—be
he of Thebes, Babylon, Benares, Alexandria or a West European cosmopolis—is
subjected to so consistent a pressure of natural-law notions that, when
scientific and philosophical prejudice (it is no more than that) dictates the
proposition that this condition of the soul is <em>the</em> soul and the mechanical
world-picture is <em>the</em> world, the assertion is scarcely challenged. It has been
made predominant by logicians like Aristotle and Kant. But Plato and Goethe
have rejected it and refuted it.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>IV</h4>

<p class='c018'>The task of world-knowing—for the man of the higher Cultures a need,
seen as a duty, of expressing his own essence—is certainly in every case the
same, though its process may be called science or philosophy, and though its
affinity to artistic creation and to faith-intuition may for one be something
felt and for another something questionable. It is to present, without accretions,
that form of the world-picture which to the individual in each case is
proper and significant, and for him (so long as he does not <em>compare</em>) is in fact
“the” world.</p>

<p class='c001'>The task is necessarily a double one, in view of the distinction between
“Nature” and “History.” Each speaks its own form-language which differs
utterly from that of the other, and however the two may overlap and confuse
one another in an unsifted and ambiguous world-picture such as that of everyday
life, they are incapable of any inner unity.</p>

<p class='c001'>Direction and Extension are the outstanding characters which differentiate
the historical and the scientific (naturhaft) kind of impressibility, and it is
totally impossible for a man to have both working creatively within him at
the same time. The double meaning of the German word “Ferne” (distance,
farness) is illuminating. In the one order of ideas it implies futurity, in the
other a spatial interval of standing apart, and the reader will not fail to remark
that the historical materialist almost necessarily conceives time as a mathematical
dimension, while for the born artist, on the contrary,—as the lyrics of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>every land show us—the distance-impressions made by deep landscapes, clouds,
horizon and setting sun attach themselves without an effort to the sense of a
future. The Greek poet denies the future, and consequently he neither sees nor
sings of the things of the future; he cleaves to the near, as he belongs to the
present, entirely.</p>

<p class='c001'>The natural-science investigator, the productive reasoner in the full sense of
the word, whether he be an experimenter like Faraday, a theorist like Galileo,
a calculator like Newton, finds in his world only directionless <em>quantities</em> which
he measures, tests and arranges. It is only the quantitative that is capable of
being grasped through figures, of being causally defined, of being captured in a
law or formula, and when it has achieved this, pure nature-knowledge has shot
its bolt. All its laws are quantitative connexions, or as the physicist puts it, all
physical processes <em>run a course in space</em>, an expression which a Greek physicist
would have corrected—without altering the fact—into “all physical processes
<em>occur between bodies</em>” conformably to the space-denying feeling of the
Classical soul.</p>

<p class='c001'>The historical kind of impression-process is alien to everything quantitative,
and affects a different organ. To World-as-Nature certain modes of apprehension,
as to World-as-History certain other modes, are <em>proper</em>. We know them and
use them every day, without (as yet) having become aware of their opposition.
There is <em>nature-knowledge</em> and there is <em>man-knowledge</em>; there is <em>scientific</em> experience
and there is <em>vital</em> experience. Let the reader track down this contrast into his
own inmost being, and he will understand what I mean.</p>

<p class='c001'>All modes of comprehending the world may, in the last analysis, be described
as Morphology. <em>The Morphology of the mechanical and the extended, a science which
discovers and orders nature-laws and causal relations, is called Systematic. The Morphology
of the organic, of history and life and all that bears the sign of direction and destiny,
is called Physiognomic.</em></p>

<h4 class='c021'>V</h4>

<p class='c018'>In the West, the Systematic mode of treating the world reached and passed
its culminating-point during the last century, while the great days of Physiognomic
have still to come. In a hundred years all sciences that are still possible
on this soil will be parts of a single vast Physiognomic of all things human.
This is what the “Morphology of World-History” means. In every science,
and in the aim no less than in the content of it, man tells the story of himself.
Scientific experience is spiritual self-knowledge. It is from this standpoint, as
a chapter of Physiognomic, that we have just treated of mathematics. We were
not concerned with what this or that mathematician <em>intended</em>, nor with the
savant as such or his results as a contribution to an aggregate of knowledge,
but with the mathematician as a human being, with his work as a part of the
phenomenon of himself, with his knowledge and purposes as a part of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>expression. This alone is of importance to us here. He is the mouthpiece of a
Culture which tells us about itself through him, and he belongs, as personality,
as soul, as discoverer, thinker and creator, to the physiognomy of that
Culture.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every mathematic, in that it brings out and makes visible to all the idea of
number that is proper to itself and inborn in its conscious being, is, whether
the expression-form be a scientific system or (as in the case of Egypt) an architecture,
the confession of a Soul. If it is true that the intentional accomplishments
of a mathematic belong only to the surface of history, it is equally true
that its unconscious element, its number-as-such, and the style in which it
builds up its self-contained cosmos of forms are an expression of its existence,
its blood. Its life-history of ripening and withering, its deep relation to the
creative acts, the myths and the cults of the same Culture—such things are the
subject-matter of a second or historical morphology, though the possibility of
such a morphology is hardly yet admitted.</p>

<p class='c001'>The visible foregrounds of history, therefore, have the same significance as
the outward phenomena of the individual man (his statue, his bearing, his air,
his stride, his way of speaking and writing), as distinct from what he says or
writes. In the “knowledge of men” these things exist and matter. The body
and all its elaborations—defined, “become” and <em>mortal</em> as they are—are an
expression of the soul. But henceforth “knowledge of men” implies also
knowledge of those superlative human organisms that I call Cultures, and of
their mien, their speech, their acts—these terms being meant as we mean them
already in the case of the individual.</p>

<p class='c001'>Descriptive, creative, Physiognomic is the art of portraiture transferred to
the spiritual domain. Don Quixote, Werther, Julian Sorel, are portraits of an
epoch, Faust the portrait of a whole Culture. For the nature-researcher, the
morphologist as systematist, the portrayal of the world is only a business of
imitation, and corresponds to the “fidelity to nature” and the “likeness” of
the craftsman-painter, who, at bottom, works on purely mathematical lines.
But a real portrait in the Rembrandt sense of the word is physiognomic, that
is, <em>history</em> captured in a moment. The set of his self-portraits is nothing else but
a (truly Goethian) autobiography. So should the biographies of the great
Cultures be handled. The “fidelity” part, the work of the professional historian
on facts and figures, is only a means, not an end. The countenance of
history is made up of all those things which hitherto we have only managed to
evaluate according to personal standards, i.e., as beneficial or harmful, good or
bad, satisfactory or unsatisfactory—political forms and economic forms,
battles and arts, science and gods, mathematics and morals. Everything whatsoever
that has <em>become</em> is a symbol, and the expression of a soul. Only to one
having the knowledge of men will it unveil itself. The restraint of a law it
abhors. What it demands is that its significance should be sensed. And thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>research reaches up to a final or superlative truth—Alles Vergängliche ist
nur ein Gleichnis.<a id='r82'></a><a href='#f82' class='c019'><sup>[82]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The nature-researcher can be educated, but the man who knows history is
born. He seizes and pierces men and facts with one blow, guided by a feeling
which cannot be acquired by learning or affected by persuasion, but which only
too rarely manifests itself in full intensity. Direction, fixing, ordering, defining
by cause and effect, are things that one can do if one likes. These things are
work, but the other is creation. Form and law, portrayal and comprehension,
symbol and formula, have different organs, and their opposition is that in
which life stands to death, production to destruction. Reason, system and comprehension
kill as they “cognize.” That which is cognized becomes a rigid
object, capable of measurement and subdivision. Intuitive vision, on the other
hand, vivifies and incorporates the details in a living inwardly-felt unity.
Poetry and historical study are kin. Calculation and cognition also are kin.
But, as Hebbel says somewhere, systems are not dreamed, and art-works are not
calculated or (what is the same thing) thought out. The artist or the real
historian sees the becoming of a thing (<span lang="de">schaut, wie etwas wird</span>), and he can re-enact
its becoming from its lineaments, whereas the systematist, whether he be
physicist, logician, evolutionist or pragmatical historian, learns the thing that
has become. The artist’s soul, like the soul of a Culture, is something potential
that may actualize itself, something complete and perfect—in the language of
an older philosophy, a microcosm. The systematic spirit, narrow and withdrawn
“abs-tract”) from the sensual, is an autumnal and passing phenomenon
belonging to the ripest conditions of a Culture. Linked with the <em>city</em>, into
which its life is more and more herded, it comes and goes with the city. In the
Classical world, there is science only from the 6th-century Ionians to the Roman
period, but there was art in the Classical world for just as long as there was
existence.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Seeking thus to obtain a clear idea of the unifying principle out of which
each of these two worlds is conceived, we find that mathematically-controlled
cognition relates always (and the purer it is, the more directly) to a continuous
present. The picture of nature dealt with by the physicist is that which
is deployed before his senses at the given moment. It is one of the tacit, but
none the less firm, presuppositions of nature-research that “Nature” (<i>die</i> Natur)
is the same for every consciousness and for all times. An experiment is decisive
for good and all; time being, not precisely denied, but eliminated from the field
of investigation. Real history rests on an equally certain sense of the contrary;
what it presupposes as its origin is a nearly indescribable sensitive faculty
within, which is continuously labile under continuous impressions, and is incapable
therefore of possessing what may be called a centre of time.<a id='r83'></a><a href='#f83' class='c019'><sup>[83]</sup></a> (We shall
consider later what the physicist means by “time.”) The picture of history—be
it the history of mankind, of the world of organisms, of the earth or of the
stellar systems—is a <em>memory</em>-picture. “Memory,” in this connexion, is conceived
as a higher state (certainly not proper to every consciousness and vouchsafed
to many in only a low degree), a perfectly definite kind of imagining power,
which enables experience to traverse each particular moment <span lang="la"><i>sub specie æternitatis</i></span>
as one point in an integral made up of all the past and all the future, and it forms
the necessary basis of all looking-backward, all self-knowledge and all self-confession.
In this sense, Classical man has no memory and therefore no history,
either in or around himself. “No man can judge history but one who has himself
experienced history,” says Goethe. In the Classical world-consciousness all
Past was absorbed in the instant Present. Compare the entirely historical heads
of the Nürnberg Cathedral sculptures, of Dürer, of Rembrandt, with those of
Hellenistic sculpture, for instance the famous Sophocles statue. The former tell
the whole history of a soul, whereas the latter rigidly confines itself to expressing
the traits of a momentary being, and tells nothing of how this being is
the issue of a course of life—if indeed we can speak of “course of life” at all in
connexion with a purely Classical man, who is always complete and never
becoming.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>VI</h3>

<p class='c018'>And now it is possible to discover the ultimate elements of the historical
form-world.</p>

<p class='c001'>Countless shapes that emerge and vanish, pile up and melt again, a thousand-hued
glittering tumult, it seems, of perfectly wilful chance—such is the picture
of world-history when first it deploys before our inner eye. But through
this seeming anarchy, the keener glance can detect those pure forms which
underlie all human becoming, penetrate their cloud-mantle, and bring them
unwillingly to unveil.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>But of the whole picture of world-becoming, of that cumulus of grand planes
that the Faust-eye<a id='r84'></a><a href='#f84' class='c019'><sup>[84]</sup></a> sees piled one beyond another—the becoming of the
heavens, of the earth’s crust, of life, of man—we shall deal here only with
that very small morphological unit that we are accustomed to call “world-history,”
that history which Goethe ended by despising, the history of higher
mankind during 6000 years or so, without going into the deep problem of the
inward homogeneity of all these aspects. What gives this fleeting form-world
meaning and substance, and what has hitherto lain buried deep under a mass of
tangible “facts” and “dates” that has hardly yet been bored through, is
the <em>phenomenon of the Great Cultures</em>. Only after these prime forms shall have been
seen and felt and worked out in respect of their physiognomic meaning will it
be possible to say that the essence and inner form of human History as opposed
to the essence of Nature are understood—or rather, that we understand them.
Only after this inlook and this outlook will a serious philosophy of history
become feasible. Only then will it be possible to see each fact in the historical
picture—each idea, art, war, personality, epoch—according to its symbolic
content, and to regard history not as a mere sum of past things without intrinsic
order or inner necessity, but as an organism of rigorous structure and
significant articulation, an organism that does not suddenly dissolve into a
formless and ambiguous future when it reaches the accidental present of the
observer.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Cultures are organisms</em>, and world-history is their collective biography. Morphologically,
the immense history of the Chinese or of the Classical Culture is
the exact equivalent of the petty history of the individual man, or of the
animal, or the tree, or the flower. For the Faustian vision, this is not a postulate
but an experience; if we want to learn to recognize inward forms that
constantly and everywhere repeat themselves, the comparative morphology<a id='r85'></a><a href='#f85' class='c019'><sup>[85]</sup></a>
of plants and animals has long ago given us the methods. In the destinies of the
several Cultures that follow upon one another, grow up with one another, touch,
overshadow, and suppress one another, is compressed the whole content of
human history. And if we set free their shapes, till now hidden all too deep
under the surface of a trite “history of human progress,” and let them march
past us in the spirit, it cannot but be that we shall succeed in distinguishing,
amidst all that is special or unessential, the primitive culture-form, <em>the</em> Culture
that underlies as ideal all the individual Cultures.</p>

<p class='c001'>I distinguish the <em>idea</em> of a Culture, which is the sum total of its inner possibilities,
from its sensible <em>phenomenon</em> or appearance upon the canvas of history
as a fulfilled actuality. It is the relation of the soul to the living body, to its
expression in the light-world perceptible to our eyes. This history of a Culture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>is the progressive actualizing of its possible, and the fulfilment is equivalent to
the end. In this way the Apollinian soul, which some of us can perhaps understand
and share in, is related to its unfolding in the realm of actuality, to the
“Classical” or “antique” as we call it, of which the tangible and understandable
relics are investigated by the archæologist, the philologist, the æsthetic
and the historian.</p>

<p class='c001'>Culture is the <em>prime phenomenon</em> of all past and future world-history. The
deep, and scarcely appreciated, idea of Goethe, which he discovered in his
“living nature” and always made the basis of his morphological researches,
we shall here apply—in its most precise sense—to all the formations of man’s
history, whether fully matured, cut off in the prime, half opened or stifled in the
seed. It is the method of living into (erfühlen) the object, as opposed to dissecting
it. “The highest to which man can attain, is wonder; and if the prime
phenomenon makes him wonder, let him be content; nothing higher can it give
him, and nothing further should he seek for behind it; here is the limit.” The
prime phenomenon is that in which the idea of becoming is presented net. To
the spiritual eye of Goethe the idea of the prime plant was clearly visible in
the form of every individual plant that happened to come up, or even that
could possibly come up. In his investigation of the “os intermaxillare” his
starting-point was the <em>prime phenomenon of the vertebrate type</em>; and in other fields
it was geological stratification, or the leaf as the prime form of the plant-organism,
or the metamorphosis of the plants as the prime form of all organic
becoming. “The same law will apply to everything else that lives,” he wrote,
in announcing his discovery to Herder. It was a look into the heart of things
that Leibniz would have understood, but the century of Darwin is as remote
from such a vision as it is possible to be.</p>

<p class='c001'>At present, however, we look in vain for any treatment of history that is
entirely free from the methods of Darwinism—that is, of systematic natural
science based on causality. A physiognomic that is precise, clear and sure of
itself and its limits has never yet arisen, and it can only arise through the discoveries
of method that we have yet to make. Herein lies the great problem
set for the 20th Century to solve—to explore carefully the inner structure
of the organic units through and in which world-history fulfils itself, to separate
the morphologically necessary from the accidental, and, by seizing the
<em>purport</em> of events, to ascertain the languages in which they speak.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>VII</h4>

<p class='c018'>A boundless mass of human Being, flowing in a stream without banks;
up-stream, a dark past wherein our time-sense loses all powers of definition and
restless or uneasy fancy conjures up geological periods to hide away an eternally-unsolvable
riddle; down-stream, a future even so dark and timeless—such is
the groundwork of the Faustian picture of human history.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Over the expanse of the water passes the endless uniform wave-train of the
generations. Here and there bright shafts of light broaden out, everywhere
dancing flashes confuse and disturb the clear mirror, changing, sparkling,
vanishing. These are what we call the clans, tribes, peoples, races which unify
a series of generations within this or that limited area of the historical surface.
As widely as these differ in creative power, so widely do the images
that they create vary in duration and plasticity, and when the creative power
dies out, the physiognomic, linguistic and spiritual identification-marks vanish
also and the phenomenon subsides again into the ruck of the generations.
Aryans, Mongols, Germans, Kelts, Parthians, Franks, Carthaginians, Berbers,
Bantus are names by which we specify some very heterogeneous images of
this order.</p>

<p class='c001'>But over this surface, too, the great Cultures<a id='r86'></a><a href='#f86' class='c019'><sup>[86]</sup></a> accomplish their majestic
wave-cycles. They appear suddenly, swell in splendid lines, flatten again and
vanish, and the face of the waters is once more a sleeping waste.</p>

<p class='c001'>A Culture is born in the moment when a great soul awakens out of the proto-spirituality
(<span lang="de"><i>dem urseelenhaften Zustande</i></span>) of ever-childish humanity, and detaches
itself, a form from the formless, a bounded and mortal thing from the
boundless and enduring. It blooms on the soil of an exactly-definable landscape,
to which plant-wise it remains bound. It dies when this soul has actualized
the full sum of its possibilities in the shape of peoples, languages, dogmas, arts,
states, sciences, and reverts into the proto-soul. But its living existence, that
sequence of great epochs which define and display the stages of fulfilment, is an
inner passionate struggle to maintain the Idea against the powers of Chaos
without and the unconscious muttering deep-down within. It is not only the
artist who struggles against the resistance of the material and the stifling of
the idea within him. Every Culture stands in a deeply-symbolical, almost in a
mystical, relation to the Extended, the space, in which and through which it
strives to actualize itself. The aim once attained—the idea, the entire content
of inner possibilities, fulfilled and made externally actual—the Culture suddenly
hardens, it mortifies, its blood congeals, its force breaks down, and it
becomes <em>Civilization</em>, the thing which we feel and understand in the words
Egypticism, Byzantinism, Mandarinism. As such they may, like a worn-out
giant of the primeval forest, thrust their decaying branches towards the sky
for hundreds or thousands of years, as we see in China, in India, in the Islamic
world. It was thus that the Classical Civilization rose gigantic, in the Imperial
age, with a false semblance of youth and strength and fullness, and robbed the
young Arabian Culture of the East of light and air.<a id='r87'></a><a href='#f87' class='c019'><sup>[87]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This—the inward and outward fulfilment, the finality, that awaits every
living Culture—is the purport of all the historic “declines,” amongst them
that decline of the Classical which we know so well and fully, and another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>decline, entirely comparable to it in course and duration, which will occupy
the first centuries of the coming millennium but is heralded already and sensible
in and around us to-day—the decline of the West.<a id='r88'></a><a href='#f88' class='c019'><sup>[88]</sup></a> Every Culture passes
through the age-phases of the individual man. Each has its childhood, youth,
manhood and old age. It is a young and trembling soul, heavy with misgivings,
that reveals itself in the morning of Romanesque and Gothic. It fills the
Faustian landscape from the Provence of the troubadours to the Hildesheim
cathedral of Bishop Bernward.<a id='r89'></a><a href='#f89' class='c019'><sup>[89]</sup></a> The spring wind blows over it. “In the works
of the old-German architecture,” says Goethe, “one sees the blossoming of an
extraordinary state. Anyone immediately confronted with such a blossoming
can do no more than wonder; but one who can see into the secret inner life
of the plant and its rain of forces, who can observe how the bud expands, little
by little, sees the thing with quite other eyes and knows what he is seeing.”
Childhood speaks to us also—and in the same tones—out of early-Homeric
Doric, out of early-Christian (which is really early-Arabian) art and out of
the works of the Old Kingdom in Egypt that began with the Fourth Dynasty.
There a mythic world-consciousness is fighting like a harassed debtor against
all the dark and daemonic in itself and in Nature, while slowly ripening itself
for the pure, day-bright expression of the existence that it will at last achieve
and know. The more nearly a Culture approaches the noon culmination of
its being, the more virile, austere, controlled, intense the form-language it has
secured for itself, the more assured its sense of its own power, the clearer its
lineaments. In the spring all this had still been dim and confused, tentative,
filled with childish yearning and fears—witness the ornament of Romanesque-Gothic
church porches of Saxony<a id='r90'></a><a href='#f90' class='c019'><sup>[90]</sup></a> and southern France, the early-Christian
catacombs, the Dipylon<a id='r91'></a><a href='#f91' class='c019'><sup>[91]</sup></a> vases. But there is now the full consciousness of
ripened creative power that we see in the time of the early Middle Kingdom
of Egypt, in the Athens of the Pisistratidæ, in the age of Justinian, in that
of the Counter-Reformation, and we find every individual trait of expression
deliberate, strict, measured, marvellous in its ease and self-confidence.
And we find, too, that everywhere, at moments, the coming fulfilment suggested
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>itself; in such moments were created the head of Amenemhet III (the so-called
“Hyksos Sphinx” of Tanis), the domes of Hagia Sophia, the paintings of
Titian. Still later, tender to the point of fragility, fragrant with the sweetness
of late October days, come the Cnidian Aphrodite and the Hall of the
Maidens in the Erechtheum, the arabesques on Saracen horseshoe-arches, the
Zwinger of Dresden, Watteau, Mozart. At last, in the grey dawn of Civilization,
the fire in the Soul dies down. The dwindling powers rise to one more,
half-successful, effort of creation, and produce the Classicism that is common
to all dying Cultures. The soul thinks once again, and in Romanticism looks
back piteously to its childhood; then finally, weary, reluctant, cold, it loses
its desire to be, and, as in Imperial Rome, wishes itself out of the overlong
daylight and back in the darkness of protomysticism, in the womb of the
mother, in the grave. The spell of a “second religiousness”<a id='r92'></a><a href='#f92' class='c019'><sup>[92]</sup></a> comes upon it,
and Late-Classical man turns to the practice of the cults of Mithras, of Isis,
of the Sun—those very cults into which a soul just born in the East has been
pouring a new wine of dreams and fears and loneliness.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>VIII</h3>

<p class='c018'>The term “habit” (Habitus) is used of a plant to signify the special way,
proper to itself, in which it manifests itself, i.e., the character, course and
duration of its appearance in the light-world where we can see it. By its habit
each kind is distinguished, in respect of each part and each phase of its existence,
from all examples of other species. We may apply this useful notion of “habit”
in our physiognomic of the grand organisms and speak of the habit of the
Indian, Egyptian or Classical Culture, history or spirituality. Some vague
inkling of it has always, for that matter, underlain the notion of <em>style</em>, and we
shall not be forcing but merely clearing and deepening that word if we speak
of the religious, intellectual, political, social or economic style<a id='r93'></a><a href='#f93' class='c019'><sup>[93]</sup></a> of a Culture.
This “habit” of existence in space, which covers in the case of the individual
man action and thought and conduct and disposition, embraces in the case or
the existence of whole Cultures the totality of life-expressions of the higher
order. The choice of particular branches of art (e.g., the round and fresco by
the Hellenes, counterpoint and oil-painting by the West) and the out-and-out
rejection of others (e.g., of plastic by the Arabs); inclination to the esoteric
(India) or the popular (Greece and Rome); preference for oratory (Classical) or
for writing (China, the West) as the form of spiritual communication, are all
style-manifestations, and so also are the various types of costume, of administration,
of transport, of social courtesies. All great personalities of the Classical
world form a self-contained group, whose spiritual habit is definitely different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>from that of all great men of the Arabian or the Western groups. Compare even
Goethe and Raphael with Classical men, and Heraclitus, Sophocles, Plato,
Alcibiades, Themistocles, Horace and Tiberius rank themselves together instantly
as members of one family. Every Classical Cosmopolis—from Hiero’s
Syracuse to Imperial Rome the embodiment and sense-picture of one and the
same life-feeling—differs radically in lay-out and street-plan, in the language
of its public and private architecture, in the type of its squares, alleys, courts,
façades, in its colour, noises, street-life and night-life, from the group of Indian
or that of Arabian or that of Western world-cities. Baghdad and Cairo could
be felt in Granada long after the conquest; even Philip II’s Madrid had all the
physiognomic hall-marks of modern London and Paris. There is a high symbolism
in every dissimilarity of this sort. Contrast the Western tendency to
straight-lined perspectives and street-alignments (such as the grand tract of the
Champs-Elysées from the Louvre, or the Piazza before St. Peter’s) with the
almost deliberate complexity and narrowness of the Via Sacra, the Forum
Romanum and the Acropolis, whose parts are arranged without symmetry and
with no perspective. Even the town-planning—whether darkly as in the
Gothic or consciously as in the ages of Alexander and Napoleon—reflects the
same principle as the mathematic—in the one case the Leibnizian mathematic
of infinite space, in the other the Euclidean mathematic of separate bodies.<a id='r94'></a><a href='#f94' class='c019'><sup>[94]</sup></a>
But to the “habit” of a group belong, further, its definite <em>life-duration</em> and its
definite tempo of development. Both of these are properties which we must not
fail to take into account in a historical theory of structure. The rhythm (Takt)
of Classical existence was different from that of Egyptian or Arabian; and we
can fairly speak of the <span lang="it"><i>andante</i></span> of Greece and Rome and the <span lang="it"><i>allegro con brio</i></span> of the
Faustian spirit.</p>

<p class='c001'>The notion of life-duration as applied to a man, a butterfly, an oak, a blade
of grass, comprises a specific time-value, which is quite independent of all the
accidents of the individual case. Ten years are a slice of life which is approximately
equivalent for all men, and the metamorphosis of insects is associated
with a number of days exactly known and predictable in individual cases.
For the Romans the notions of <span lang="la"><i>pueritia</i></span>, <span lang="la"><i>adolescentia</i></span>, <span lang="la"><i>iuventus</i></span>, <span lang="la"><i>virilitas</i></span>, <span lang="la"><i>senectus</i></span>
possessed an almost mathematically precise meaning. Without doubt the biology
of the future will—in opposition to Darwinism and to the exclusion in
principle of causal fitness-motives for the origins of species—take these <em>pre-ordained</em>
life durations as the starting-point for a new enunciation of its problem.<a id='r95'></a><a href='#f95' class='c019'><sup>[95]</sup></a>
The duration of a generation—whatever may be its nature—is a fact
of almost mystical significance.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, such relations are valid also, and to an extent never hitherto imagined,
for all the higher Cultures. <em>Every Culture, every adolescence and maturing and decay
of a Culture, every one of its intrinsically necessary stages and periods, has a definite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>duration, always the same, always recurring with the emphasis of a symbol.</em> In the
present work we cannot attempt to open up this world of most mysterious
connexions, but the facts that will emerge again and again as we go on will
tell us of themselves how much lies hidden here. What is the meaning of that
striking fifty-year period, the rhythm of the political, intellectual and artistic
“becoming” of all Cultures?<a id='r96'></a><a href='#f96' class='c019'><sup>[96]</sup></a> Of the 300-year period of the Baroque, of the
Ionic, of the great mathematics, of Attic sculpture, of mosaic painting, of
counterpoint, of Galileian mechanics? What does the <em>ideal</em> life of one millennium
for each Culture mean in comparison with the individual man’s
"three-score years and ten"? As the plant’s being is brought to expression
in form, dress and carriage by leaves, blossoms, twigs and fruit, so also is the
being of a Culture manifested by its religious, intellectual, political and
economic formations. Just as, say, Goethe’s individuality discourses of itself
in such widely-different forms as the <cite>Faust</cite>, the <span lang="de"><cite>Farbenlehre</cite></span>, the <span lang="de"><cite>Reineke Fuchs</cite></span>,
<span lang="de"><cite>Tasso</cite></span>, <span lang="de"><cite>Werther</cite></span>, the journey to Italy and the Friederike love, the <span lang="de"><cite>Westöstliche
Diwan</cite></span> and the <span lang="de"><cite>Römische Elegien</cite></span>; so the individuality of the Classical world
displays itself in the Persian wars, the Attic drama, the City-State, the Dionysia
and not less in the Tyrannis, the Ionic column, the geometry of Euclid,
the Roman legion, and the gladiatorial contests and <span lang="la">“panem et circenses”</span> of
the Imperial age.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this sense, too, every individual being that has any sort of importance
recapitulates,<a id='r97'></a><a href='#f97' class='c019'><sup>[97]</sup></a> of intrinsic necessity, all the epochs of the Culture to which it
belongs. In each one of us, at that decisive moment when he begins to know
that he is an ego, the inner life wakens just where and just how that of the
Culture wakened long ago. Each of us men of the West, in his child’s day-dreams
and child’s play, lives again its Gothic—the cathedrals, the castles,
the hero-sagas, the crusader’s <span lang="fr">“Dieu le veult,”</span> the soul’s oath of young Parzival.
Every young Greek had his Homeric age and his Marathon. In Goethe’s
Werther, the image of a tropic youth that every Faustian (but no Classical)
man knows, the springtime of Petrarch and the Minnesänger reappears. When
Goethe blocked out the <span lang="de"><i>Urfaust</i></span>,<a id='r98'></a><a href='#f98' class='c019'><sup>[98]</sup></a> he was Parzival; when he finished <span lang="de"><cite>Faust I</cite></span>, he
was Hamlet, and only with <span lang="de"><cite>Faust II</cite></span> did he become the world-man of the 19th
Century whom Byron could understand. Even the senility of the Classical—the
faddy and unfruitful centuries of very late Hellenism, the second-childhood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>of a weary and blasé intelligence—can be studied in more than one of its grand
old men. Thus, much of Euripides’ <cite>Bacchæ</cite> anticipates the life-outlook, and
much of Plato’s <cite>Timæus</cite> the religious syncretism of the Imperial age; and
Goethe’s <span lang="de"><cite>Faust II</cite></span> and Wagner’s <span lang="de"><cite>Parsifal</cite></span> disclose to us in advance the shape
that <em>our</em> spirituality will assume in our next (<em>in point of creative power our last</em>)
centuries.</p>

<p class='c001'>Biology employs the term <em>homology</em> of organs to signify morphological
equivalence in contradistinction to the term <em>analogy</em> which relates to functional
equivalence. This important, and in the sequel most fruitful, notion was conceived
by Goethe (who was led thereby to the discovery of the <span lang="la">“os intermaxillare”</span>
in man) and put into strict scientific shape by Owen;<a id='r99'></a><a href='#f99' class='c019'><sup>[99]</sup></a> this notion
also we shall incorporate in our historical method.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is known that for every part of the bone-structure of the human head an
exactly corresponding part is found in all vertebrated animals right down to
the fish, and that the pectoral fins of fish and the feet, wings and hands of
terrestrial vertebrates are homologous organs, even though they have lost
every trace of similarity. The lungs of terrestrial, and the swim-bladders
of aquatic animals are homologous, while lungs and gills on the other hand
are analogous—that is, similar in point of use.<a id='r100'></a><a href='#f100' class='c019'><sup>[100]</sup></a> And the trained and deepened
morphological insight that is required to establish such distinctions is an
utterly different thing from the present method of historical research, with its
shallow comparisons of Christ and Buddha, Archimedes and Galileo, Cæsar
and Wallenstein, parcelled Germany and parcelled Greece. More and more
clearly as we go on, we shall realize what immense views will offer themselves
to the historical eye as soon as the rigorous morphological method has been
understood and cultivated. To name but a few examples, <em>homologous</em> forms are:
Classical sculpture and West European orchestration, the Fourth Dynasty pyramids
and the Gothic cathedrals, Indian Buddhism and Roman Stoicism (Buddhism
and Christianity are <em>not even analogous</em>); the periods of “the Contending
States” in China, the Hyksos in Egypt and the Punic Wars; the age of Pericles
and the age of the Ommayads; the epochs of the Rigveda, of Plotinus and of
Dante. The Dionysiac movement is homologous with the Renaissance, analogous
to the Reformation. For us, "Wagner is the <span lang="fr"><i>résumé</i></span> of modernity," as
Nietzsche rightly saw; and the equivalent that logically <em>must</em> exist in the Classical
modernity we find in Pergamene art. (Some preliminary notion of the fruitfulness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>of this way of regarding history, may be gathered from studying the
tables included in this volume.)</p>

<p class='c001'>The application of the “homology” principle to historical phenomena
brings with it an entirely new connotation for the word “contemporary.” I
designate as contemporary two historical facts that occur in exactly the same—relative—positions
in their respective Cultures, and therefore possess exactly
equivalent importance. It has already been shown how the development of
the Classical and that of the Western mathematic proceeded in complete congruence,
and we might have ventured to describe Pythagoras as the contemporary
of Descartes, Archytas of Laplace, Archimedes of Gauss. The Ionic and
the Baroque, again, ran their course <em>contemporaneously</em>. Polygnotus pairs in
time with Rembrandt, Polycletus with Bach. The Reformation, Puritanism
and, above all, the turn to Civilization appear simultaneously in all Cultures;
in the Classical this last epoch bears the names of Philip and Alexander, in our
West those of the Revolution and Napoleon. Contemporary, too, are the
building of Alexandria, of Baghdad, and of Washington; Classical coinage and
our double-entry book-keeping; the first Tyrannis and the Fronde; Augustus
and Shih-huang-ti;<a id='r101'></a><a href='#f101' class='c019'><sup>[101]</sup></a> Hannibal and the World War.</p>

<p class='c001'>I hope to show that without exception all great creations and forms in
religion, art, politics, social life, economy and science appear, fulfil themselves
and die down <em>contemporaneously</em> in all the Cultures; that the inner structure of one
corresponds strictly with that of all the others; that there is not a single phenomenon
of deep physiognomic importance in the record of one for which we
could not find a counterpart in the record of every other; and that this counterpart
is to be found under a characteristic form and in a perfectly definite chronological
position. At the same time, if we are to grasp such homologies of facts,
we shall need to have a far deeper insight and a far more critical attitude
towards the visible foreground of things than historians have hitherto been
wont to display; who amongst them, for instance, would have allowed himself
to dream that the counterpart of Protestantism was to be found in the
Dionysiac movement, and that English Puritanism was for the West what
Islam was for the Arabian world?</p>

<p class='c001'>Seen from this angle, history offers possibilities far beyond the ambitions
of all previous research, which has contented itself in the main with arranging
the facts of the past so far as these were known (and that according to a one-line
scheme)—the possibilities, namely, of</p>
<p class='c028'>Overpassing the present as a research-limit, and predetermining the
spiritual form, duration, rhythm, meaning and product of the <em>still unaccomplished</em>
stages of our western history; and</p>

<p class='c028'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Reconstructing long-vanished and unknown epochs, even whole Cultures
of the past, by means of morphological connexions, in much the
same way as modern palæontology deduces far-reaching and trustworthy
conclusions as to skeletal structure and species from a single unearthed
skull-fragment.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is possible, given the physiognomic rhythm, to recover from scattered
details of ornament, building, script, or from odd political, economic and religious
data, the organic characters of whole centuries of history, and from
known elements on the scale of art-expression, to find corresponding elements
on the scale of political forms, or from that of mathematical forms to read
that of economic. This is a truly Goethian method—rooted in fact in
Goethe’s conception of the <em>prime phenomenon</em>—which is already to a limited
extent current in comparative zoology, but can be extended, to a degree hitherto
undreamed of, over the whole field of history.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c016'>II <br> THE IDEA OF DESTINY AND THE PRINCIPLE OF CAUSALITY</h3>

<h4 class='c021'>I</h4>

<p class='c018'>Following out this train of thought to the end, we come into the presence of
an opposition in which we perceive the key—the only key—wherewith to
approach, and (so far as the word has any meaning at all) to solve, one of the
oldest and gravest of man’s riddles. This is the opposition of the <em>Destiny Idea</em>
and the <em>Causality Principle</em>—an opposition which, it is safe to say, has never
hitherto been recognized for what it is, the necessary foundation of world-building.</p>

<p class='c001'>Anyone who understands at all what is meant by saying that the soul is the
<em>idea of an existence</em>, will also divine a near relationship between it and the <em>sure
sense of a destiny</em> and must regard Life itself (our name for the form in which the
actualizing of the possible is accomplished) as directed, irrevocable in every
line, fate-laden. Primitive man feels this dimly and anxiously, while for the
man of a higher Culture it is definite enough to become his vision of the world—though
this vision is communicable only through religion and art, never
through notions and proofs.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every higher language possesses a number of words such as luck, doom,
conjuncture, vocation, about which there is, as it were, a veil. No hypothesis,
no science, can ever get into touch with that which we feel when we let ourselves
sink into the meaning and sound of these words. They are symbols, not
notions. In them is the centre of gravity of that world-picture that I have
called the World-as-history as opposed to the World-as-nature. The Destiny-idea
demands life-experience and not scientific experience, the power of seeing
and not that of calculating, depth and not intellect. There is an <em>organic logic</em>,
an instinctive, dream-sure logic of all existence as opposed to the <em>logic of the
inorganic</em>, the logic of understanding and of things understood—a logic of
direction as against a logic of extension—and no systematist, no Aristotle or
Kant, has known how to deal with it. They are on their own ground when
they tell us about “judgment,” “perception,” “awareness,” and “recollection,”
but as to what is in the words “hope,” “happiness,” “despair,” “repentance,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>“devotion,” and “consolation” they are silent. He who expects
here, in the domain of the living, to find reasons and consequences, or imagines
that an inward certainty as to the meaning of life is the same thing as “Fatalism”
or “Predestination,” simply knows nothing of the matters in question,
confusing experience lived with experience acquired or acquirable. Causality
is the reasonable, the law-bound, the describable, the badge of our whole
waking and reasoning existence. But destiny is the word for an inner certainty
that is <em>not</em> describable. We bring out that which is in the causal by means of
a physical or an epistemological system, through numbers, by reasoned classification;
but the idea of destiny can be imparted only by the artist working
through media like portraiture, tragedy and music. The one requires us to
<em>distinguish</em> and in distinguishing to dissect and destroy, whereas the other is
<em>creative</em> through and through, and thus destiny is related to life and causality
to death.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the Destiny-idea the soul reveals its world-longing, its desire to rise
into the light, to accomplish and actualize its vocation. To no man is it entirely
alien, and not before one has become the unanchored “late” man of the
megalopolis is original vision quite overpowered by matter-of-fact feeling and
mechanizing thought. Even then, in some intense hour, the lost vision comes
back to one with terrible clearness, shattering in a moment all the causality
of the world’s surface. For the world as a system of causal connexions is not
only a “late” but also a highly rarefied conception and only the energetic
intellects of high Cultures are capable of possessing it—or perhaps we should
say, devising it—with conviction. The notion of causality is coterminous
with the notion of law: the only laws that are, are causal laws. But just as
there lies in the causal, according to Kant, a <em>necessity of the thinking consciousness</em>
and the <em>basic form of its relation to the essence of things</em>, so also, designated by the
words destiny, dispensation, vocation, there is a something that is an inevitable
<em>necessity of life</em>. Real history is heavy with fate but free of laws. One can
divine the future (there is, indeed, a certain insight that can penetrate its secrets
deeply) but one cannot reckon it. The physiognomic flair which enables one
to read a whole life in a face or to sum up whole peoples from the picture of
an epoch—and to do so without deliberate effort or “system”—is utterly
remote from all “cause and effect.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He who comprehends the light-world that is before his eyes not physiognomically
but systematically, and makes it intellectually his own by the
methods of <em>causal</em> experience, must necessarily in the end come to believe that
every living thing can be understood by reference to cause and effect—that
there is no secret and no inner directedness. He, on the other hand, who as
Goethe did—and for that matter as everyone does in nine out of ten of his
waking moments—lets the impressions of the world about him work merely
upon his senses, absorbs these impressions as a whole, feels the become in its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>becoming. The stiff mask of causality is lifted by mere <em>ceasing to think</em>. Suddenly,
Time is no more a riddle, a notion, a “form” or “dimension” but becomes
an inner certainty, destiny itself; and in its directedness, its <em>irreversibility</em>,
its livingness, is disclosed the very meaning of the historical world-picture.
<em>Destiny and Causality are related as Time and Space.</em></p>

<p class='c001'>In the two possible world-forms then—History and Nature, the physiognomy
of all becoming and the system of all things become—destiny <em>or</em> causality
prevails. Between them there is all the difference between a feeling of life and
a method of knowledge. Each of them is the starting-point of a complete and
self-contained, but not <em>of a unique</em> world. Yet, after all, just as the become is
founded upon a becoming, so the <em>knowledge</em> of cause and effect is founded upon
the sure <em>feeling</em> of a destiny. Causality is—so to say—destiny become, destiny
made inorganic and modelled in reason-forms. Destiny itself (passed over
in silence by Kant and every other builder of rational world-systems because
with their armoury of <em>abstractions</em> they could not touch <em>life</em>) stands beyond and
outside all comprehended Nature. Nevertheless, being itself the original, it
alone gives the stiff dead principle of cause-and-effect the opportunity to figure
in the later scenes of a culture-drama, alive and historical, as the incarnation
of a tyrannical thinking. The existence of the Classical soul is the <em>condition</em> for
the appearance of Democritus’s method, the existence of the Faustian soul for
that of Newton’s. We may well imagine that either of these Cultures might
have failed to produce a natural science of its own, but we cannot imagine the
systems without their cultural foundations.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here again we see how becoming and the become, direction and extension,
include one another and are subordinated each to the other, according as we
are in the historical or in the “natural” focus. If history is that kind of world-order
in which all the become is fitted to the becoming, then the products of
scientific work must <span lang="la"><i>inter alia</i></span> be so handled; and, in fact, for the historical eye
there is only a <em>history</em> of physics. It was Destiny that the discoveries of oxygen,
Neptune, gravitation and spectrum analysis happened as and when they did.
It was Destiny that the phlogiston theory, the undulatory theory of light, the
kinetic theory of gases could arise at all, seeing that they were elucidations of
results and, as such, highly personal to their respective authors, and that other
theories (“correct” or “erroneous”) might equally well have been developed
instead. And it is again Destiny and the result of strong personality when one
theory vanishes and another becomes the lodestar of the physicist’s world.
Even the born physicist speaks of the “fate” of a problem or the “history”
of a discovery.</p>

<p class='c001'>Conversely, if “Nature” is that constitution of things in which the becoming
should logically be incorporated in the thing-become, and living direction
in rigid extension, history may best be treated as a chapter of epistemology;
and so indeed Kant would have treated it if he had remembered to include it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>at all in his system of knowledge. Significantly enough, he did not; for him as
for every born systematist Nature is <em>The</em> World, and when he discusses time
without noticing that it has direction and is irreversible, we see that he is
dealing with the Nature-world and has no inkling of the possibility of another,
the history-world. Perhaps, for Kant, this other world <em>was</em> actually
impossible.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, <em>Causality has nothing whatever to do with Time</em>. To the world of to-day,
made up of Kantians who know not how Kantian they are, this must seem an
outrageous paradox. And yet every formula of Western physics exhibits the
“how” and the “how long” as distinct in essence. As soon as the question
is pressed home, causality restricts its answer rigidly to the statement <em>that</em>
something happens—and not <em>when</em> it happens. The “effect” must of necessity
be put with the “cause.” The <em>distance</em> between them belongs to a different
order, it lies within the act of understanding itself (which is an element of
life) and not within the thing or things understood. It is of the essence of the
extended that it overcomes directedness, and of Space that it contradicts Time,
<em>and yet the latter, as the more fundamental, precedes and underlies the former</em>. Destiny
claims the same precedence; we begin with the idea of Destiny, and only later,
when our waking-consciousness looks fearfully for a spell that will bind in the
sense-world and overcome the death that cannot be evaded, do we conceive
causality as an anti-Fate, and make it <em>create another world to protect us from and
console us for this</em>. And as the web of cause and effect gradually spreads over the
visible surfaces there is formed a convincing picture of timeless duration—essentially,
Being, but Being endowed with attributes by the sheer force of
pure thought. This tendency underlies the feeling, well known in all mature
Cultures, that “Knowledge is Power,” the power that is meant being power
over Destiny. The abstract savant, the natural-science researcher, the thinker
in systems, whose whole intellectual existence bases itself on the causality
principle, are “late” manifestations of an unconscious <em>hatred</em> of the powers of
incomprehensible Destiny. “Pure Reason” denies all possibilities that are
outside itself. Here strict thought and great art are eternally in conflict. The
one keeps its feet, and the other lets itself go. A man like Kant must always
feel himself as superior to a Beethoven as the adult is to the child, but this will
not prevent a Beethoven from regarding the “Critique of Pure Reason” as a
pitiable sort of philosophy. <em>Teleology</em>, that nonsense of all nonsenses within
science, is a misdirected attempt to deal mechanically with the <em>living</em> content
of scientific knowledge (for knowledge implies someone to know, and though
the substance of thought may be “Nature” the <em>act</em> of thought is history), and
so with life itself as an inverted causality. Teleology is a caricature of the
Destiny-idea which transforms the <em>vocation</em> of Dante into the <em>aim</em> of the savant.
It is the deepest and most characteristic tendency both of Darwinism—the
megalopolitan-intellectual product of the most abstract of all Civilizations—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>of the materialist conception of history which springs from the same root
as Darwinism and, like it, kills all that is organic and fateful. Thus the morphological
element of the Causal is a <em>Principle</em>, and the morphological element
of Destiny is an <em>Idea</em>, an idea that is incapable of being “cognized,” described
or defined, and can only be felt and inwardly lived. This idea is something of
which one is either entirely ignorant or else—like the man of the spring and
every truly significant man of the late seasons, believer, lover, artist, poet—entirely
certain.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus Destiny is seen to be the true <em>existence-mode of the prime phenomenon</em>, that
in which the living idea of becoming unfolds itself immediately to the intuitive
vision. And therefore the Destiny-idea dominates the whole world-picture of
history, while causality, which is the existence-mode of <em>objects</em> and stamps out
of the world of sensations a set of well-distinguished and well-defined <em>things</em>,
<em>properties</em> and <em>relations</em>, dominates and penetrates, as the form of the understanding,
the Nature-world that is the understanding’s “alter ego.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But inquiry into the degree of validity of causal connexions within a presentation
of nature, or (what is henceforth the same thing for us) into the
destinies involved in that presentation, becomes far more difficult still when we
come to realize that for primitive man or for the child no comprehensive
causally-ordered world exists at all as yet and that we ourselves, though “late”
men with a consciousness disciplined by powerful speech-sharpened thought,
can do no more, even in moments of the most strained attention (the only
ones, really, in which we are exactly in the physical focus), than <em>assert</em> that the
causal order which we see in such a moment is continuously present in the
actuality around us. Even waking, we take in the actual, “the living garment
of the Deity,” <em>physiognomically</em>, and we do so involuntarily and by virtue of a
power of experience that is rooted in the deep sources of life.</p>

<p class='c001'>A <em>systematic</em> delineation, on the contrary, is the expression of an understanding
emancipated from perception, and by means of it we bring the mental
picture of all times and all men into conformity with the moment’s picture of
Nature as ordered by ourselves. But the mode of this ordering, which has a
history that we cannot interfere with in the smallest degree, is not the working
of a cause, but a destiny.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>II</h4>

<p class='c018'>The way to the problem of Time, then, begins in the primitive wistfulness
and passes through its clearer issue the Destiny-idea. We have now to try to
outline, briefly, the content of that problem, so far as it affects the subject of
this book.</p>

<p class='c001'>The <em>word</em> Time is a sort of charm to summon up that intensely personal
something designated earlier as the “proper,” which with an inner certainty
we oppose to the “alien” something that is borne in upon each of us amongst
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>and within the crowding impressions of the sense-life. “The Proper,” “Destiny”
and “Time” are interchangeable words.</p>

<p class='c001'>The problem of Time, like that of Destiny, has been completely misunderstood
by all thinkers who have confined themselves to the systematic of the
Become. In Kant’s celebrated theory there is not one word about its character
of directedness. Not only so, but the omission has never even been noticed.
But what <em>is</em> time as a length, time without direction? Everything living, we
can only repeat, has “life,” direction, impulse, will, a movement-quality (Bewegtheit)
that is most intimately allied to yearning and has not the smallest
element in common with the “motion” (<span lang="de">Bewegung</span>) of the physicists. The
living is indivisible and irreversible, once and uniquely occurring, and its course
is entirely indeterminable by mechanics. For all such qualities belong to the
essence of Destiny, and “Time”—that which we actually feel at the sound of
the word, which is clearer in music than in language, and in poetry than in
prose—has this <em>organic</em> essence, while Space has not. Hence, Kant and the
rest notwithstanding, it is impossible to bring Time <em>with Space</em> under one general
Critique. Space is a <em>conception</em>, but time is a <em>word</em> to indicate something inconceivable,
a sound-symbol, and to use it as a notion, scientifically, is utterly to
misconceive its nature. Even the word direction—which unfortunately cannot
be replaced by another—is liable to mislead owing to its visual content.
The vector-notion in physics is a case in point.</p>

<p class='c001'>For primitive man the word “time” can have no meaning. He simply lives,
without any necessity of specifying an opposition to something else. He <em>has</em>
time, but he <em>knows</em> nothing of it. All of us are conscious, as being aware, of
space only, and not of time. Space “is,” (i.e. exists, in and with our sense-world)—as
a self-extension while we are living the ordinary life of dream,
impulse, intuition and conduct, and as space in the strict sense in the
moments of strained attention. “Time,” on the contrary, is a <em>discovery</em>, which
is only made by thinking. We create it as an idea or notion and do not begin
till much later to suspect that <em>we ourselves are Time</em>, inasmuch as we live.<a id='r102'></a><a href='#f102' class='c019'><sup>[102]</sup></a> And
only the higher Cultures, whose world-conceptions have reached the
mechanical-Nature stage, are capable of deriving from their consciousness of a
well-ordered measurable and comprehensible Spatial, the projected image of
time, the <em>phantom</em> time,<a id='r103'></a><a href='#f103' class='c019'><sup>[103]</sup></a> which satisfies their need of comprehending, measuring
and causally ordering all. And this impulse—a sign of the sophistication of
existence that makes its appearance quite early in every Culture—fashions,
outside and beyond the real life-feeling, that which is called time in all higher
languages and has become for the town-intellect a completely <em>inorganic magnitude</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>as deceptive as it is current. But, if the characteristics, or rather the
characteristic, of extension—limit and causality—is really wizard’s gear wherewith
our proper soul attempts to conjure and bind alien powers—Goethe
speaks somewhere of the “principle of reasonable order that we bear within
ourselves and could impress as the seal of our power upon everything that we
touch”—if all law is a fetter which our world-dread hurries to fix upon the
incrowding sensuous, a deep necessity of self-preservation, so also the invention
of a time that is knowable and spatially representable within causality is a later
act of this same self-preservation, an attempt to bind by the force of <em>notion</em> the
tormenting inward riddle that is doubly tormenting to the intellect that has
attained power only to find itself defied. Always a subtle hatred underlies the
intellectual process by which anything is forced into the domain and form-world
of measure and law. The living is <em>killed</em> by being introduced into space,
for space is dead and makes dead. With birth is given death, with the fulfilment
the end. Something <em>dies</em> within the woman when she conceives—hence comes
that eternal hatred of the sexes, child of world-fear. The man destroys, in a
very deep sense, when he begets—by bodily act in the sensuous world, by
“knowing” in the intellectual. Even in Luther<a id='r104'></a><a href='#f104' class='c019'><sup>[104]</sup></a> the word “know” has the
secondary genital sense. And with the “knowledge” of life—which remains
alien to the lower animals—the knowledge of death has gained that power
which dominates man’s whole waking consciousness. By a <em>picture</em> of time the
actual is changed into the transitory.<a id='r105'></a><a href='#f105' class='c019'><sup>[105]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The mere creation of the <em>name</em> Time was an unparalleled deliverance. To
name anything by a name is to win power over it. This is the essence of primitive
man’s art of magic—the evil powers are constrained by naming them, and
the enemy is weakened or killed by coupling certain magic procedures with his
name.<a id='r106'></a><a href='#f106' class='c019'><sup>[106]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>And there is something of this primitive expression of world-fear in the way
in which all systematic philosophies use mere names as a last resort for getting
rid of the Incomprehensible, the Almighty that is all too mighty for the intellect.
We name something or other the “Absolute,” and we feel ourselves at
once its superior. Philosophy, the <em>love</em> of Wisdom, is at the very bottom defence
against the incomprehensible. What is named, comprehended, measured is
<span lang="la"><i>ipso facto</i></span> overpowered, made inert and taboo.<a id='r107'></a><a href='#f107' class='c019'><sup>[107]</sup></a> Once more, “knowledge is
power.” Herein lies one root of the difference between the idealist’s and the
realist’s attitude towards the Unapproachable; it is expressed by the two meanings
of the German word <span lang="de"><i>Scheu</i></span>—respect and abhorrence.<a id='r108'></a><a href='#f108' class='c019'><sup>[108]</sup></a> The idealist contemplates,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>the realist would subject, mechanize, render innocuous. Plato and
Goethe accept the secret in humility, Aristotle and Kant would open it up and
destroy it. The most deeply significant example of this realism is in its treatment
of the Time problem. The dread mystery of Time, life itself, must be
spellbound and, by the magic of comprehensibility, neutralized.</p>

<p class='c001'>All that has been said about time in “scientific” philosophy, psychology
and physics—the supposed answer to a question that had better never have
been asked, namely what <em>is</em> time?—touches, not at any point the secret itself,
but only a spatially-formed <em>representative</em> phantom. The livingness and directedness
and fated course of real Time is replaced by a figure which, be it never so
intimately absorbed, is only a <i>line</i>, measurable, divisible, reversible, and not a
portrait of that which is incapable of being portrayed; by a “time” that can
be mathematically expressed in such forms as √<i>t</i>, <i>t</i>², -<i>t</i>, from which the
assumption of a time of zero magnitude or of negative times is, to say the least,
<em>not</em> excluded.<a id='r109'></a><a href='#f109' class='c019'><sup>[109]</sup></a> Obviously this is something quite outside the domain of Life,
Destiny, and living <em>historical</em> Time; it is a purely conceptual time-system that
is remote even from the sensuous life. One has only to substitute, in any
philosophical or physical treatise that one pleases, this word “Destiny” for
the word “time” and one will instantly see how understanding loses its way
when language has emancipated it from sensation, and how impossible the
group “time and space” is. What is not experienced and felt, what is merely
<em>thought</em>, necessarily takes a <em>spatial</em> form, and this explains why no systematic
philosopher has been able to make anything out of the mystery-clouded, far-echoing
sound symbols “Past” and “Future.” In Kant’s utterances concerning
time they do not even occur, and in fact one cannot see any relation which
could connect them with what is said there. But only this spatial form enables
time and space to be brought into functional interdependence as magnitudes
<em>of the same</em> order, as four-dimensional vector analysis<a id='r110'></a><a href='#f110' class='c019'><sup>[110]</sup></a> conspicuously shows.
As early as 1813 Lagrange frankly described mechanics as a four-dimensional
geometry, and even Newton’s cautious conception of <span lang="la">“tempus absolutum sive
duratio”</span> is not exempt from this <em>intellectually inevitable</em> transformation of the
living into mere extension. In the older philosophy I have found one, and only
one, profound and reverent presentation of Time; it is in Augustine—“If no
one questions me, I know: if I would explain to a questioner, I know not.”<a id='r111'></a><a href='#f111' class='c019'><sup>[111]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>When philosophers of the present-day West “hedge”—as they all do—by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>saying that things <em>are</em> in time as in space and that “outside” them nothing
is “conceivable,” they are merely putting another kind of space (Räumlichkeit)
beside the ordinary one, just as one might, if one chose, call hope and electricity
the two forces of the universe. It ought not, surely, to have escaped Kant
when he spoke of the “two forms” of perception, that whereas it is easy
enough to come to a scientific understanding about space (though not to “explain”
it, in the ordinary sense of the word, for that is beyond human powers),
treatment of time on the same lines breaks down utterly. The reader of the
“Critique of Pure Reason” and the “Prolegomena” will observe that Kant
gives a well-considered proof for the connexion of space and geometry but
carefully avoids doing the same for time and arithmetic. There he did not go
beyond enunciation, and constant reassertion of analogy between the two
conceptions lured him over a gap that would have been fatal to his system.
<span lang="fr"><i>Vis-à-vis</i></span> the Where and the How, the When forms a world of its own as distinct
as is metaphysics from physics. Space, object, number, notion, causality are so
intimately akin that it is impossible—as countless mistaken systems prove—to
treat the one independently of the other. Mechanics is a copy of the logic
of its day and vice versa. The picture of thought as psychology builds it up and
the picture of the space-world as contemporary physics describes it are reflections
of one another. Conceptions and things, reasons and causes, conclusions and
processes coincide so nicely, as received by the consciousness, that the abstract
thinker himself has again and again succumbed to the temptation of setting
forth the thought-“process” graphically and schematically—witness Aristotle’s
and Kant’s tabulated categories. “Where there is no scheme, there is no
philosophy” is the objection of principle—unacknowledged though it may
be—that all professional philosophers have against the “intuitives,” to whom
inwardly they feel themselves far superior. That is why Kant crossly describes
the Platonic style of thinking “as the art of spending good words in babble”
(die Kunst, wortreich zu schwatzen), and why even to-day the lecture-room
philosopher has not a word to say about Goethe’s philosophy. Every logical
operation is capable of being <em>drawn</em>, every system a <em>geometrical</em> method of
handling thoughts. And therefore Time either finds no place in the system
at all, or is made its victim.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is the refutation of that widely-spread misunderstanding which connects
time with arithmetic and space with geometry by superficial analogies,
an error to which Kant ought never to have succumbed—though it is hardly
surprising that Schopenhauer, with his incapacity for understanding mathematics,
did so. Because the living act of numbering is somehow or other related to
time, number and time are constantly confused. But numbering is not number,
any more than drawing is a drawing. Numbering and drawing are a becoming,
numbers and figures are things become. Kant and the rest have in mind now
the living act (numbering) and now the result thereof (the relations of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>finished figure); but the one belongs to the domain of Life and Time, the other
to that of Extension and Causality. <em>That</em> I calculate is the business of organic,
<em>what</em> I calculate the business of inorganic, logic. Mathematics as a whole—in
common language, arithmetic and geometry—answers the <em>How?</em> and the
<em>What?</em>—that is, the problem of the Natural order of things. In opposition
to this problem stands that of the <em>When?</em> of things, the specifically
historical problem of destiny, future and past; and all these things are comprised
in the word <em>Chronology</em>, which simple mankind understands fully and
unequivocally.</p>

<p class='c001'>Between arithmetic and geometry there is no opposition.<a id='r112'></a><a href='#f112' class='c019'><sup>[112]</sup></a> Every kind of
number, as has been sufficiently shown in an earlier chapter, belongs entirely to
the realm of the extended and the become, whether as a Euclidean magnitude
or as an analytical function; and to which heading should we have to assign
the cyclometric<a id='r113'></a><a href='#f113' class='c019'><sup>[113]</sup></a> functions, the Binomial Theorem, the Riemann surfaces, the
Theory of Groups? Kant’s scheme was refuted by Euler and d’Alembert before
he even set it up, and only the unfamiliarity of his successors with the mathematics
of their time—what a contrast to Descartes, Pascal and Leibniz, who
evolved the mathematics of <em>their</em> time from the depths of their own philosophy!—made
it possible for mathematical notions of a relation between time and
arithmetic to be passed on like an heirloom, almost uncriticized.</p>

<p class='c001'>But between Becoming and any part whatsoever of mathematics there is not
the slightest contact. Newton indeed was profoundly convinced (and he was
no mean philosopher) that in the principles of his Calculus of Fluxions<a id='r114'></a><a href='#f114' class='c019'><sup>[114]</sup></a> he had
grasped the problem of Becoming, and therefore of Time—in a far subtler
form, by the way, than Kant’s. But even Newton’s view could not be upheld,
even though it may find advocates to this day. Since Weierstrass proved that
continuous functions exist which either cannot be differentiated at all or are
capable only of partial differentiation, this most deep-searching of all efforts
to close with the Time-problem mathematically has been abandoned.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>III</h3>

<p class='c018'><em>Time is a counter-conception (<span lang="de">Gegenbegriff</span>) to Space</em>, arising out of Space, just as
the notion (as distinct from the fact) of Life arises only in opposition to
thought, and the notion (as distinct from the fact) of birth and generation only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>in opposition to death.<a id='r115'></a><a href='#f115' class='c019'><sup>[115]</sup></a> This is implicit in the very essence of all awareness.
Just as any sense-impression is only remarked when it detaches itself from
another, so any kind of understanding that is genuine critical activity<a id='r116'></a><a href='#f116' class='c019'><sup>[116]</sup></a> is only
made possible through the setting-up of a new concept as anti-pole to one
already present, or through the divorce (if we may call it so) of a pair of
inwardly-polar concepts which as long as they are mere constituents, possess no
actuality.<a id='r117'></a><a href='#f117' class='c019'><sup>[117]</sup></a> It has long been presumed—and rightly, beyond a doubt—that
all root-words, whether they express things or properties, have come into being
by pairs; but even later, even to-day, the connotation that every new word receives
is a reflection of some other. And so, guided by language, the understanding,
incapable of fitting a sure inward subjective certainty of Destiny into its
form-world, created “time” out of space as its opposite. But for this we should
possess neither the word nor its connotation. And so far is this process of
word-formation carried that the particular style of extension possessed by the
Classical world led to a specifically Classical notion of time, differing from the
time-notions of India, China and the West exactly as Classical space differs from
the space of these Cultures.<a id='r118'></a><a href='#f118' class='c019'><sup>[118]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>For this reason, the notion of an art-form—which again is a “counter-concept”—has
only arisen when men became aware that their art-creations
had a connotation (Gehalt) at all, that is, when the expression-language of the
art, along with its effects, had ceased to be something perfectly natural and
taken-for-granted, as it still was in the time of the Pyramid-Builders, in that
of the Mycenæan strongholds and in that of the early Gothic cathedrals. Men
become suddenly aware of the existence of “works,” and then for the first time
the understanding eye is able to distinguish a causal side and a destiny side in
every living art.</p>

<p class='c001'>In every work that displays the <em>whole</em> man and the <em>whole</em> meaning of the
existence, fear and longing lie close together, but they are and they remain
different. To the fear, to the Causal, belongs the whole “taboo” side of art—its
stock of motives, developed in strict schools and long craft-training, carefully
protected and piously transmitted; all of it that is comprehensible, learnable,
<em>numerical</em>; all the <em>logic</em> of colour, line, structure, order, which constitutes
the mother-tongue of every worthy artist and every great epoch. But the other
side, opposed to the “taboo” as the directed is to the extended and as the development-destiny
within a form-language to its syllogisms, comes out in
genius (namely, in that which is wholly personal <em>to the individual artists</em>, their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>imaginative powers, creative passion, depth and richness, as against all mere
mastery of form) and, beyond even genius, in that superabundance of creativeness
in the race which conditions the rise and fall of whole arts. This is the
“totem” side, and owing to it—notwithstanding all the æsthetics ever
penned—there is no timeless and solely-true way of art, but only a <em>history</em> of
art, marked like everything that lives with the sign of irreversibility.<a id='r119'></a><a href='#f119' class='c019'><sup>[119]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>And this is why architecture of the grand style—which is the only one of
the arts that handles the alien and fear-instilling itself, the immediate Extended,
the stone—is naturally <em>the</em> early art in all Cultures, and only step by step
yields its primacy to the special arts of the city with their more mundane
forms—the statue, the picture, the musical composition. Of all the great
artists of the West, it was probably Michelangelo who suffered most acutely
under the constant nightmare of world-fear, and it was he also who, alone
among the Renaissance masters, never freed himself from the architectural.
He even painted as though his surfaces were stone, become, stiff, <em>hateful</em>. His
work was a bitter wrestle with the powers of the cosmos which faced him and
challenged him in the form of material, whereas in the yearning Leonardo’s
colour we see, as it were, a glad materialization of the <a id='corr128.18'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='spritual'>spiritual</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_128.18'>spiritual</a></span>. But in every
large architectural problem an implacable causal logic, not to say mathematic,
comes to expression—in the Classical orders of columns a Euclidean relation
of <em>beam</em> and <em>load</em>, in the “analytically” disposed thrust-system of Gothic vaulting
the dynamic relation of <em>force</em> and <em>mass</em>. Cottage-building traditions—which
are to be traced in the one and in the other, which are the necessary background
even of Egyptian architecture, which in fact develop in every early
period and are regularly lost in every later—contain the whole sum of this
logic of the extended. But the symbolism of direction and destiny is beyond
all the “technique” of the great arts and hardly approachable by way of
æsthetics. It lies—to take some instances—in the contrast that is always
felt (but never, either by Lessing or by Hebbel, elucidated) between Classical
and Western tragedy; in the succession of scenes of old Egyptian relief and
generally in the <em>serial</em> arrangement of Egyptian statues, sphinxes, temple-halls;
in the choice, as distinct from the treatment, of materials (hardest diorite to
affirm, and softest wood to deny, the future); in the occurrence, and not in the
grammar, of the individual arts, e.g., the victory of arabesque over the Early
Christian picture, the retreat of oil-painting before chamber music in the
Baroque; in the utter diversity of intention in Egyptian, Chinese and Classical
statuary. All these are not matters of “can” but of “must,” and therefore it is
not mathematics and abstract thought, but the great arts in their kinship with
the contemporary religions, that give the key to the problem of Time, a problem
that can hardly be solved within the domain of history<a id='r120'></a><a href='#f120' class='c019'><sup>[120]</sup></a> alone.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>
  <h3 class='c016'>IV</h3>
</div>

<p class='c018'>It follows from the meaning that we have attached to the Culture as a prime
phenomenon and to destiny as the organic logic of existence, that each Culture
must necessarily possess its own destiny-idea. Indeed, this conclusion is implicit
from the first in the feeling that every great Culture is nothing but the
actualizing and form of a single, singularly-constituted (einzigartig) soul.
And what cannot be felt by one sort of men exactly as it is felt by another (since
the life of each is the expression of the idea <em>proper</em> to himself) and still less
transcribed, what is named by us “conjuncture,” “accident,” “Providence”
or “Fate,” by Classical man “Nemesis,” “Ananke,” “Tyche” or “Fatum,”
by the Arab “Kismet,” by everyone in some way of his own, is just that of
which each unique and unreproduceable soul-constitution, quite clear to those
who share in it, is a rendering.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Classical form of the Destiny-idea I shall venture to call Euclidean.
Thus it is the sense-actual person of Œdipus, his “empirical ego,” nay, his
σῶμα that is hunted and thrown by Destiny. Œdipus complains that Creon
has misused his “body”<a id='r121'></a><a href='#f121' class='c019'><sup>[121]</sup></a> and that the oracle applied to his “body.”<a id='r122'></a><a href='#f122' class='c019'><sup>[122]</sup></a> Æschylus,
again, speaks of Agamemnon as the “royal body, leader of fleets.”<a id='r123'></a><a href='#f123' class='c019'><sup>[123]</sup></a> It is
this same word σῶμα that the mathematicians employ more than once for the
“bodies” with which they deal. But the destiny of King Lear is of the “analytical”
type—to use here also the term suggested by the corresponding
number-world—and consists in dark inner relationships. The idea of fatherhood
emerges; spiritual threads weave themselves into the action, incorporeal
and transcendental, and are weirdly illuminated by the counterpoint of the
secondary tragedy of Gloster’s house. Lear is at the last a mere name, the axis
of something unbounded. <em>This</em> conception of destiny is the “infinitesimal”
conception. It stretches out into infinite time and infinite space. It touches
the bodily, Euclidean existence not at all, but affects only the Soul. Consider
the mad King between the fool and the outcast in the storm on the heath, and
then look at the Laocoön group; the first is the Faustian, the other the Apollinian
way of suffering. Sophocles, too, wrote a Laocoön drama; and we may be
certain that there was nothing of <em>pure soul-agony</em> in it. Antigone goes below
ground in the body, because she has buried her brother’s body. Think of Ajax
and Philoctetes, and then of the Prince of Homburg and Goethe’s Tasso—is
not the difference between magnitude and relation traceable right into the
depths of artistic creation?</p>

<p class='c001'>This brings us to another connexion of high symbolic significance. The
drama of the West is ordinarily designated <em>Character-Drama</em>. That of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Greeks, on the other hand, is best described as <em>Situation-Drama</em>, and in the
antithesis we can perceive what it is that Western, and what it is that Classical,
man respectively feel as the basic life-form that is imperilled by the onsets of
tragedy and fate. If in lieu of “direction” we say “irreversibility,” if we let
ourselves sink into the terrible meaning of those words “too late” wherewith
we resign a fleeting bit of the present to the <em>eternal</em> past, we find the deep foundation
of every tragic crisis. It is Time that is the tragic, and it is by the meaning
that it intuitively attaches to Time that one Culture is differentiated from
another; and consequently “tragedy” of the grand order has only developed in
the Culture which has most passionately affirmed, and in that which has most
passionately denied, Time. The sentiment of the ahistoric soul gives us a
Classical tragedy of the moment, and that of the ultrahistorical soul puts before
us Western tragedy that deals with the <em>development of a whole life</em>. Our tragedy
arises from the feeling of an <em>inexorable</em> Logic of becoming, while the Greek feels
the <em>illogical, blind Casual of the moment</em>—the life of Lear matures inwardly towards
a catastrophe, and that of Œdipus stumbles without warning upon a
situation. And now one may perceive how it is that synchronously with
Western drama there rose and fell a mighty portrait-art (culminating in Rembrandt),
a kind of historical and biographical art which (<em>because</em> it was so) was
sternly discountenanced in Classical Greece at the apogee of Attic drama.
Consider the veto on likeness-statuary in votive offerings<a id='r124'></a><a href='#f124' class='c019'><sup>[124]</sup></a> and note how—from
Demetrius of Alopeke (about 400)<a id='r125'></a><a href='#f125' class='c019'><sup>[125]</sup></a>—a timid art of “ideal” portraiture
began to venture forth when, and only when, grand tragedy had been thrown
into the background by the light society-pieces of the “Middle Comedy.”<a id='r126'></a><a href='#f126' class='c019'><sup>[126]</sup></a>
Fundamentally all Greek statues were standard masks, like the actors in the
theatre of Dionysus; all bring to expression, in significantly strict form, <em>somatic</em>
attitudes and positions. Physiognomically they are <em>dumb</em>, corporeal and <em>of
necessity</em> nude—character-heads of definite individuals came only with the
Hellenistic age. Once more we are reminded of the contrast between the Greek
number-world, with its computations of tangible results, and the other, our
own, in which the relations between groups of functions or equations or, generally,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>formula-elements of the same order are investigated morphologically, and
the character of these relations fixed <em>as such</em> in express laws.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>V</h3>

<p class='c018'>In the capacity of experientially living history and the way in which history,
particularly the history of personal becoming, is lived, one man differs very
greatly from another.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every Culture possesses a wholly individual way of looking at and comprehending
the world-as-Nature; or (what comes to the same thing) it <em>has</em> its own
peculiar “Nature” which no other sort of man can possess in exactly the same
form. But in a far greater degree still, every Culture—including the individuals
comprising it (who are separated only by minor distinctions)—possesses
a specific and peculiar sort of history—and it is in the picture of this and the
style of this that the general and the personal, the inner and the outer, the
world-historical and the biographical becoming, are immediately perceived,
felt and lived. Thus the autobiographical tendency of Western man—revealed
even in Gothic times in the symbol of auricular confession<a id='r127'></a><a href='#f127' class='c019'><sup>[127]</sup></a>—is utterly
alien to Classical man; while his intense historical awareness is in complete
contrast to the almost dreamy unconsciousness of the Indian. And when
Magian man—primitive Christian or ripe scholar of Islam—uses the words
“world-history,” what is it that he sees before him?</p>

<p class='c001'>But it is difficult enough to form an exact idea even of the “Nature” proper
to another kind of man, although in this domain things specifically cognizable
are causally ordered and unified in a communicable system. And it is quite
impossible for us to penetrate completely a historical world-aspect of “becoming”
formed by a soul that is quite differently constituted from our own. Here
there must always be an intractable residue, greater or smaller in proportion
to our historical instinct, physiognomic tact and knowledge of men. All the
same, the solution of this very problem is the condition-precedent of all really
deep understanding of the world. The historical environment of another is a
part of his <em>essence</em>, and no such other can be understood without the knowledge
of his time-sense, his destiny-idea and the style and degree of acuity of his inner
life. In so far therefore as these things are not directly confessed, we have to
extract them from the symbolism of the alien Culture. And as it is thus and
only thus that we can approach the incomprehensible, the style of an alien
Culture, and the great time-symbols belonging thereto acquire an immeasurable
importance.</p>

<p class='c001'>As an example of these hitherto almost uncomprehended signs we may take
the <em>clock</em>, a creation of highly developed Cultures that becomes more and more
mysterious as one examines it. Classical man managed to do without the clock,
and his abstention was more or less deliberate. To the Augustan period, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>far beyond it, the time of day was estimated by the length of one’s shadow,<a id='r128'></a><a href='#f128' class='c019'><sup>[128]</sup></a>
although sun-dials and water-clocks, designed in conformity with a strict
time-reckoning and imposed by a deep sense of past and future, had been in
regular use in both the older Cultures of Egypt and Babylonia.<a id='r129'></a><a href='#f129' class='c019'><sup>[129]</sup></a> Classical man’s
existence—Euclidean, relationless, point-formed—was wholly contained in
the instant. Nothing must remind him of past or future. For the true Classical,
archæology did not exist, nor did its <em>spiritual inversion</em>, <em>astrology</em>. The Oracle
and the Sibyl, like the Etruscan-Roman “haruspices” and “augurs,” did not
foretell any distant future but merely gave indications on particular questions
of immediate bearing. No time-reckoning entered intimately into everyday
life (for the Olympiad sequence was a mere literary expedient) and what really
matters is not the goodness or badness of a calendar but the questions: “who
uses it?” and “does the life of the nation run by it?” In Classical cities nothing
suggested duration, or old times or times to come—there was no pious preservation
of ruins, no work conceived for the benefit of future generations; in
them we do not find that durable<a id='r130'></a><a href='#f130' class='c019'><sup>[130]</sup></a> material was deliberately chosen. The
Dorian Greek ignored the Mycenæan stone-technique and built in wood or
clay, though Mycenæan and Egyptian work was before him and the country
produced first-class building-stone. The Doric style is a timber style—even
in Pausanias’s day some wooden columns still lingered in the Heræum of
Olympia. The real organ of history is “memory” in the sense which is always
postulated in this book, viz., that which preserves as a constant present the
image of one’s personal past and of a national and a world-historical past<a id='r131'></a><a href='#f131' class='c019'><sup>[131]</sup></a> as
well, and is conscious of the course both of personal and of super-personal
becoming. That organ was not present in the make-up of a Classical soul.
There was no “Time” in it. Immediately behind his proper present, the
Classical historian sees a background that is already destitute of temporal and
therefore of inward order. For Thucydides the Persian Wars, for Tacitus the
agitation of the Gracchi, were already in this vague background;<a id='r132'></a><a href='#f132' class='c019'><sup>[132]</sup></a> and the
great families of Rome had traditions that were pure romance—witness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>Cæsar’s slayer, Brutus, with his firm belief in his reputed tyrannicide ancestor.
Cæsar’s reform of the calendar may almost be regarded as a deed
of emancipation from the Classical life-feeling. But it must not be forgotten
that Cæsar also imagined a renunciation of Rome and a transformation of
the City-State into an empire which was to be dynastic—marked with the
badge of duration—and to have its centre of gravity in Alexandria, which
in fact is the birthplace of his calendar. His assassination seems to us a last
outburst of the antiduration feeling that was incarnate in the <span lang="la"><i>Polis</i></span> and the
<span lang="la"><i>Urbs Roma</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even then Classical mankind was still living every hour and every day for
itself; and this is equally true whether we take the individual Greek or Roman,
or the city, or the nation, or the whole Culture. The hot-blooded pageantry,
palace-orgies, circus-battles of Nero or Caligula—Tacitus is a true Roman
in describing only these and ignoring the smooth progress of life in the distant
provinces—are final and flamboyant expressions of the Euclidean world-feeling
that deified the body and the present.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Indians also have no sort of time-reckoning (the absence of it in their
case expressing their Nirvana) and no clocks, and <em>therefore</em> no history, no life
memories, no care. What the conspicuously historical West calls “Indian
history” achieved itself without the smallest consciousness of what it was
doing.<a id='r133'></a><a href='#f133' class='c019'><sup>[133]</sup></a> The millennium of the Indian Culture between the Vedas and Buddha
seems like the stirrings of a sleeper; here life was <em>actually</em> a dream. From all
this our Western Culture is unimaginably remote. And, indeed, man has never—not
even in the “contemporary” China of the Chóu period with its highly-developed
sense of eras and epochs<a id='r134'></a><a href='#f134' class='c019'><sup>[134]</sup></a>—been so awake and aware, so deeply
sensible of time and conscious of direction and fate and movement as he has
been in the West. <em>Western history was willed and Indian history happened.</em> In
Classical existence years, in Indian centuries scarcely counted, but here the hour,
the minute, yea the second, is of importance. Of the tragic tension of a historical
crisis like that of August, 1914, when even moments seem overpowering,
neither a Greek nor an Indian could have had any idea.<a id='r135'></a><a href='#f135' class='c019'><sup>[135]</sup></a> Such crises, too, a
deep-feeling man of the West can experience <em>within himself</em>, as a true Greek could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>never do. Over our country-side, day and night from thousands of belfries,
ring the bells<a id='r136'></a><a href='#f136' class='c019'><sup>[136]</sup></a> that join future to past and fuse the point-moments of the Classical
present into a grand relation. The epoch which marks the birth of our
Culture—the time of the Saxon Emperors—marks also the discovery of the
wheel-clock.<a id='r137'></a><a href='#f137' class='c019'><sup>[137]</sup></a> Without exact time-measurement, without a <em>chronology of becoming</em>
to correspond with his imperative need of archæology (the preservation,
excavation and collection of <em>things-become</em>), Western man is unthinkable. The
Baroque age intensified the Gothic symbol of the belfry to the point of grotesqueness,
and produced the pocket watch that constantly accompanies the
individual.<a id='r138'></a><a href='#f138' class='c019'><sup>[138]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Another symbol, as deeply significant and as little understood as the symbol
of the clock, is that of the funeral customs which all great Cultures have consecrated
by ritual and by art. The grand style in India begins with tomb-temples,
in the Classical world with funerary urns, in Egypt with pyramids,
in early Christianity with catacombs and sarcophagi. In the dawn, innumerable
equally-possible forms still cross one another chaotically and obscurely, dependent
on clan-custom and external necessities and conveniences. But every
Culture promptly elevates one or another of them to the highest degree of
symbolism. Classical man, obedient to his deep unconscious life-feeling,
picked upon burning, an act of annihilation in which the Euclidean, the here-and-now,
type of existence was powerfully expressed. He <em>willed</em> to have no
history, no duration, neither past nor future, neither preservation nor dissolution,
and therefore he <em>destroyed</em> that which no longer possessed a present, the
<em>body</em> of a Pericles, a Cæsar, a Sophocles, a Phidias. And the soul passed to
join the vague crowd to which the living members of the clan paid (but soon
ceased to pay) the homage of ancestor-worship and soul-feast, and which in its
<em>formlessness</em> presents an utter contrast to the ancestor-<em>series</em>, the <em>genealogical tree</em>,
that is eternalized with all the marks of historical order in the family-vault of
the West. In this (with one striking exception, the Vedic dawn in India) no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>other Culture parallels the Classical.<a id='r139'></a><a href='#f139' class='c019'><sup>[139]</sup></a> And be it noted that the Doric-Homeric
spring, and above all the “Iliad,” invested this act of burning with all the vivid
feeling of a <em>new-born</em> symbol; for those very warriors whose deeds probably
formed the nucleus of the epic were in fact buried almost in the Egyptian manner
in the graves of Mycenæ, Tiryns, Orchomenos and other places. And when in
Imperial times the sarcophagus or “flesh-consumer”<a id='r140'></a><a href='#f140' class='c019'><sup>[140]</sup></a> began to supersede the
vase of ashes, it was again, as in the time when the Homeric urn superseded
the shaft-grave of Mycenæ, a <em>changed sense of Time</em> that underlay the change
of rite.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Egyptians, who preserved their past in memorials of stone and
hieroglyph so purposefully that we, four thousand years after them, can
determine the order of their kings’ reigns, so thoroughly eternalized their
bodies that today the great Pharaohs lie in our museums, recognizable in
every lineament, a symbol of grim triumph—while of Dorian kings not even
the names have survived. For our own part, we know the exact birthdays
and deathdays of almost every great man since Dante, and, moreover, we
see nothing strange in the fact. Yet in the time of Aristotle, the very zenith
of Classical education, it was no longer known with certainty if Leucippus,
the founder of Atomism and a contemporary of Pericles—i.e., hardly a
century before—had ever existed at all; much as though for us the existence
of Giordano Bruno was a matter of doubt<a id='r141'></a><a href='#f141' class='c019'><sup>[141]</sup></a> and the Renaissance had become
pure saga.</p>

<p class='c001'>And these museums themselves, in which we assemble everything that is
left of the corporeally-sensible past! Are not they a symbol of the highest rank?
Are they not intended to conserve in mummy the entire “body” of cultural
development?</p>

<p class='c001'>As we collect countless data in milliards of printed books, do we not
also collect <em>all</em> the works of <em>all</em> the dead Cultures in these myriad halls of
West-European cities, in the mass of the collection depriving each individual
piece of that instant of actualized purpose that is its own—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>one property that the Classical soul would have respected—and <span lang="la"><i>ipso facto</i></span>
dissolving it into our unending and unresting Time? Consider what it
was that the Hellenes named Μουσεῖον;<a id='r142'></a><a href='#f142' class='c019'><sup>[142]</sup></a> how deep a significance lies in the
change of sense!</p>

<h3 class='c016'>VI</h3>

<p class='c018'>It is the <em>primitive feeling of Care</em><a id='r143'></a><a href='#f143' class='c019'><sup>[143]</sup></a> which dominates the physiognomy of
Western, as also that of Egyptian and that of Chinese history, and it creates,
further, the symbolism of the erotic which represents the flowing on of endless
life in the form of the familial series of individual existences. The point-formed
Euclidean existence of Classical man, in this matter as in others, conceived
only the here-and-now definitive act of begetting or of bearing, and thus
it comes about that we find the birth-pangs of the mother made the centre of
Demeter-worship and the Dionysiac symbol of the phallus (the sign of a
sexuality wholly concentrated on the moment and losing past and future in it)
more or less everywhere in the Classical. In the Indian world we find, correspondingly,
the sign of the Lingam and the sect of worshippers of Paewati.<a id='r144'></a><a href='#f144' class='c019'><sup>[144]</sup></a>
In the one case as in the other, man feels himself as nature, as a plant, as a willless
and care-less element of becoming (dem Sinn des Werdens willenlos und
sorglos hingegeben). The domestic religion of Rome centred on the <em>genius</em>,
i.e., the creative power of the head of the family. To all this, the deep and
thoughtful care of the Western soul has opposed the sign of <em>mother-love</em>, a
symbol which in the Classical Culture only appeared above the horizon to
the extent that we see it in, say, the mourning for Persephone or (though
this is only Hellenistic) the seated statue of Demeter of Knidos.<a id='r145'></a><a href='#f145' class='c019'><sup>[145]</sup></a> The Mother
with the Child—the future—at her breast, the Mary-cult in the new Faustian
form, began to flourish only in the centuries of the Gothic and found
its highest expression in Raphael’s Sistine Madonna.<a id='r146'></a><a href='#f146' class='c019'><sup>[146]</sup></a> This conception is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>not one belonging to Christianity generally. On the contrary, Magian Christianity
had elevated Mary as Theotokos, “she who gave birth to God”<a id='r147'></a><a href='#f147' class='c019'><sup>[147]</sup></a>
into a symbol felt quite otherwise than by us. The lulling Mother is as
alien to Early-Christian-Byzantine art as she is to the Hellenic (though for
other reasons) and most certainly Faust’s Gretchen, with the deep spell of unconscious
motherhood on her, is nearer to the Gothic Madonna than all the
Marys of Byzantine and Ravennate mosaics. Indeed, the presumption of a
spiritual relation between them breaks down completely before the fact that
the Madonna with the Child answers exactly to the Egyptian Isis with Horus—both
are caring, nursing mothers—and that nevertheless this symbol had
vanished for a thousand years and more (for the whole duration of the Classical
and the Arabian Cultures) before it was reawakened by the Faustian soul.<a id='r148'></a><a href='#f148' class='c019'><sup>[148]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>From the maternal care the way leads to the paternal, and there we meet
with the highest of all the time-symbols that have come into existence within
a Culture, the State. The meaning of the child to the mother is the future, the
continuation, namely, of her own life, and mother-love is, as it were, a welding
of two discontinuous individual existences; likewise, the meaning of the state
to the man is comradeship in arms for the protection of hearth and home, wife
and child, and for the insurance for the whole people of its future and its efficacy.
The state is the inward form of a nation, its “form” in the athletic sense, and
history, in the high meaning, is the State conceived as kinesis and not as kinema
(<span lang="de">nicht als Bewegtes sondern als Bewegung gedacht</span>). <em>The Woman as Mother is,
and the Man as Warrior and Politician makes, History.</em><a id='r149'></a><a href='#f149' class='c019'><sup>[149]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>And here again the history of higher Cultures shows us three examples of
state-formations in which the element of care is conspicuous: the Egyptian
administration even of the Old Kingdom (from 3000 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>); the Chinese state
of the Chóu dynasty (1169-256 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>), of the organization of which the Chóu Li
gives such a picture that, later on, no one dared to believe in the authenticity
of the book; and the states of the West, behind whose characteristic eye-to-the-future
there is an unsurpassably intense Will to the future.<a id='r150'></a><a href='#f150' class='c019'><sup>[150]</sup></a> And on the
other hand we have in two examples—the Classical and the Indian world—a
picture of utterly care-less submission to the moment and its incidents.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Different in themselves as are Stoicism and Buddhism (the old-age dispositions
of these two worlds), they are at one in their negation of the historical feeling
of care, their contempt of zeal, of organizing power, and of the duty-sense;
and therefore neither in Indian courts nor in Classical market-places was there
a thought for the morrow, personal or collective. The <span lang="la"><i>carpe diem</i></span> of Apollinian
man applies also to the Apollinian state.</p>

<p class='c001'>As with the political, so with the other side of historical existence, the
economic. The hand-to-mouth life corresponds to the love that begins and
ends in the satisfaction of the moment. There was an economic organization
on the grand scale in Egypt, where it fills the whole culture-picture, telling
us in a thousand paintings the story of its industry and orderliness; in China,
whose mythology of gods and legend-emperors turns entirely upon the holy
tasks of cultivation; and in Western Europe, where, beginning with the model
agriculture of the Orders, it rose to the height of a special science, “national
economy,” which was in very principle a <em>working hypothesis</em>, purporting to show
not what happens but what <em>shall</em> happen. In the Classical world, on the other
hand—to say nothing of India—men managed from day to day, in spite of
the example of Egypt; the earth was robbed not only of its wealth but of its
capacities, and the casual surpluses were instantly squandered on the city
mob. Consider critically any great statesman of the Classical—Pericles and
Cæsar, Alexander and Scipio, and even revolutionaries like Cleon and Tiberius
Gracchus. Not one of them, economically, looked far ahead. No city ever
made it its business to drain or to afforest a district, or to introduce advanced
cultivation methods or new kinds of live stock or new plants. To attach a
Western meaning to the “agrarian reform” of the Gracchi is to misunderstand
its purport entirely. Their aim was to make their supporters <em>possessors</em> of land.
Of educating these into managers of land, or of raising the standard of Italian
husbandry in general, there was not the remotest idea—one let the future
come, one did not attempt to work upon it. Of this economic Stoicism of the
Classical world the exact antithesis is Socialism, meaning thereby not Marx’s
theory but Frederick William I’s Prussian practice which long preceded Marx
and will yet displace him—the socialism, inwardly akin to the system of Old
Egypt, that comprehends and cares for permanent economic relations, trains
the individual in his duty to the whole, and glorifies hard work as an affirmation
of Time and Future.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>VII</h4>

<p class='c018'>The ordinary everyday man in all Cultures only observes so much of the
physiognomy of becoming—his own and that of the living world around him—as
is in the foreground and immediately tangible. The sum of his experiences,
inner and outer, fills the course of his day merely as a series of facts.
Only the outstanding (bedeutende) man feels behind the commonplace unities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>of the history-stirred surface a deep logic of becoming. This logic, manifesting
itself in the idea of Destiny, leads him to regard the less significant collocations
of the day and the surface as mere incidents.</p>

<p class='c001'>At first sight, however, there seems to be only a difference of degree in the
connotations of “destiny” and “incident.” One feels that it is more or less
of an incident when Goethe goes to Sesenheim, but destiny when he goes to
Weimar;<a id='r151'></a><a href='#f151' class='c019'><sup>[151]</sup></a> one regards the former as an episode and the latter as an epoch. But
we can see at once that the distinction depends on the inward quality of the
man who is impressed. To the mass, the whole life of Goethe may appear as a
sequence of anecdotal incidents, while a very few will become conscious, with
astonishment, of a symbolic necessity inherent even in its most trivial occurrences.
Perhaps, then, the discovery of the heliocentric system by Aristarchus
was an unmeaning incident for the Classical Culture, but its supposed<a id='r152'></a><a href='#f152' class='c019'><sup>[152]</sup></a> rediscovery
by Copernicus a destiny for the Faustian? Was it a destiny that Luther
was not a great organizer and Calvin was? And if so, for whom was it a destiny—for
Protestantism as a living unit, for the Germans, or for Western
mankind generally? Were Tiberius Gracchus and Sulla incidents and Cæsar a
destiny?</p>

<p class='c001'>Questions like these far transcend the domain of the understanding that
operates through concepts (der begriffliche Verständigung). What is destiny,
what incident, the spiritual experiences of the individual soul—and of the
Culture-soul—decide. Acquired knowledge, scientific insight, definition, are
all powerless. Nay more, the very attempt to grasp them epistemologically
defeats its own object. For without the inward certainty that destiny is something
entirely intractable to critical thought, we cannot perceive the world of
becoming at all. Cognition, judgment, and the establishment of <em>causal</em> connexions
within the known (i.e., between things, properties, and positions that
have been distinguished) are one and the same, and he who approaches history
in the spirit of <em>judgment</em> will only find “data.” But that—be it Providence or
Fate—which moves in the depths of present happening or of represented past
happening is lived, and only lived, and lived with that same overwhelming
and unspeakable certainty that genuine Tragedy awakens in the uncritical
spectator. Destiny and incident form an opposition in which the soul is ceaselessly
trying to clothe something which consists <em>only</em> of feeling and living and
intuition, and can only be made plain in the most subjective religious and
artistic creations of those men who are <em>called</em> to divination. To evoke this
root-feeling of living existence which endows the picture of history with its
meaning and content, I know of no better way—for “name is mere noise and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>smoke”—than to quote again those stanzas of Goethe which I have placed at
the head of this book to mark its fundamental intention.</p>

<p class='c018'>On the surface of history it is the <em>unforeseen</em> that reigns. Every individual
event, decision and personality is stamped with its hall-mark. No one foreknew
the storm of Islam at the coming of Mohammed, nor foresaw Napoleon in the
fall of Robespierre. The coming of great men, their doings, their fortune, are
all incalculables. No one knows whether a development that is setting in
powerfully will accomplish its course in a straight line like that of the Roman
patrician order or will go down in doom like that of the Hohenstaufen or the
Maya Culture. And—science notwithstanding—it is just the same with the
destinies of every single species of beast and plant within earth-history and
beyond even this, with the destiny of the earth itself and all the solar systems
and Milky Ways. The insignificant Augustus made an epoch, and the great
Tiberius passed away ineffective. Thus, too, with the fortunes of artists, artworks
and art-forms, dogmas and cults, theories and discoveries. That, in the
whirl of becoming, one element merely succumbed to destiny when another
became (and often enough has continued and will continue to be) a destiny
itself—that one vanishes with the wave-train of the surface while the other
<em>makes</em> this, is something that is not to be explained by any why-and-wherefore
and yet is of inward necessity. And thus the phrase that Augustine in a deep
moment used of Time is valid also of destiny—“if no one questions me, I
know: if I would explain to a questioner, I know not.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So, also, the supreme ethical expression of Incident and Destiny is found in
the Western Christian’s idea of Grace—the grace, obtained through the sacrificial
death of Jesus, of being made free to will.<a id='r154'></a><a href='#f154' class='c019'><sup>[154]</sup></a> The polarity of Disposition
(original sin) and Grace—a polarity which must ever be a projection of feeling,
of the emotional life, and not a precision of learned reasoning—embraces the
existence of every truly significant man of this Culture. It is, even for Protestants,
even for atheists, hidden though it may be behind a scientific notion of
“evolution” (which in reality is its direct descendant<a id='r155'></a><a href='#f155' class='c019'><sup>[155]</sup></a>), the foundation of
every confession and every autobiography; and it is just its absence from the
constitution of Classical man that makes confession, by word or thought,
impossible to him. It is the final meaning of Rembrandt’s self-portraits and of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>music from Bach to Beethoven. We may choose to call that something which
correlates the life-courses of all Western men disposition, Providence or “inner
evolution”<a id='r156'></a><a href='#f156' class='c019'><sup>[156]</sup></a> but it remains inaccessible to thought. “Free will” is an inward
certitude. But whatever one may will or do, that which actually ensues upon
and issues from the resolution—abrupt, surprising, unforeseeable—<em>subserves</em>
a deeper necessity and, for the eye that sweeps over the picture of the distant
past, visibly conforms to a major order. And when the Destiny of that which
was willed has been Fulfilment we are fain to call the inscrutable “Grace.”
What did Innocent III, Luther, Loyola, Calvin, Jansen, Rousseau and Marx
will, and what came of the things that they willed in the stream of Western
history? Was it Grace or Fate? Here all rationalistic dissection ends in nonsense.
The Predestination doctrine of Calvin and Pascal—who, both of them
more upright than Luther and Thomas Aquinas, dared to draw the causal conclusion
from Augustinian dialectic—is the <em>necessary</em> absurdity to which the
pursuit of these secrets by the reason leads. They lost the destiny-logic of the
world-becoming and found themselves in the causal logic of notion and law;
they left the realm of direct intuitive vision for that of a mechanical system of
objects. The fearful soul-conflicts of Pascal were the strivings of a man, at once
intensely spiritual and a born mathematician, who was determined to subject
the last and gravest problems of the soul both to the intuitions of a grand
instinctive faith and to the abstract precision of a no less grand mathematical
plan. In this wise the Destiny-idea—in the language of religion, God’s Providence—is
brought <em>within the schematic form of the Causality Principle</em>, i.e., the
Kantian form of mind activity (productive imagination); <em>for that is what Predestination
signifies</em>, notwithstanding that thereby Grace—the causation-free, living
Grace which can only be experienced as an inward certainty—is made to appear
as a nature-force that is bound by irrevocable law and to turn the religious world-picture
into a rigid and gloomy system of machinery. And yet was it not a
Destiny again—for the world as well as for themselves—that the English
Puritans, who were filled with this conviction, were ruined not through any
passive self-surrender but through their hearty and vigorous certainty that
their will was the will of God?</p>

<h3 class='c016'>VIII</h3>

<p class='c018'>We can proceed to the further elucidation of the incidental (or casual)
without running the risk of considering it as an exception or a breach in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>causal continuity of “Nature,” for Nature is <em>not</em> the world-picture in which
Destiny is operative. Wherever the sight emancipates itself from the sensible-become,
spiritualizes itself into Vision, penetrates through the enveloping
world and lets prime phenomena instead of mere objects work upon it, we have
the grand <em>historical</em>, trans-natural, super-natural outlook, the outlook of Dante
and Wolfram and also the outlook of Goethe in old age that is most clearly
manifested in the finale of Faust II. If we linger in contemplation in this world
of Destiny and Incident, it will very likely seem to us incidental that the
episode of “world-history” should have played itself out in this or that phase
of one particular star amongst the millions of solar systems; incidental that it
should be men, peculiar animal-like creatures inhabiting the crust of this star,
that present the spectacle of “knowledge” and, moreover, present it in just
this form or in just that form, according to the very different versions of
Aristotle, Kant and others; incidental that as the counter-pole of this “knowing”
there should have arisen just these codes of “natural law,” each supposedly
eternal and universally-valid and each evoking a supposedly general and
common picture of “Nature.” Physics—quite rightly—banishes incidentals
from its field of view, but it is incidental, again, that physics itself should occur
in the alluvial period of the earth’s crust, uniquely, as a particular kind of
intellectual composition.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>The world of incident is the world of once-actual facts that longingly or anxiously
we live forward to (entgegenleben) as Future, that raise or depress us as the living
Present, and that we contemplate with joy or with grief as Past. The world of causes
and effects is the world of the constantly-possible, of the timeless truths which we know
by dissection and distinction.</em></p>

<p class='c001'>The latter only are scientifically attainable—they are indeed <em>identical</em> with
science. He who is blind to this other, to the world as <span lang="it"><cite>Divina Commedia</cite></span> or
drama for a god, can only find a senseless turmoil of incidents,<a id='r157'></a><a href='#f157' class='c019'><sup>[157]</sup></a> and here we use
the word in its most trivial sense. So it has been with Kant and most other
systematists of thought. But the professional and inartistic sort of historical
research too, with its collecting and arranging of mere data, amounts for all its
ingenuity to little more than the giving of a <span lang="fr"><i>cachet</i></span> to the banal-incidental. Only
the insight that can penetrate into the metaphysical is capable of experiencing
in data <em>symbols</em> of that which happened, and so of elevating an Incident into a
Destiny. And he who is to himself a Destiny (like Napoleon) does not need
this insight, since between himself as a fact and the other facts there is a
harmony of metaphysical rhythm which gives his decisions their dreamlike
certainty.<a id='r158'></a><a href='#f158' class='c019'><sup>[158]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It is this insight that constitutes the singularity and the power of Shakespeare.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Hitherto, neither our research nor our speculation has hit upon this in
him—that he is <em>the Dramatist of the Incidental</em>. And yet this Incidental is the very
heart of Western tragedy, which is a true copy of the Western history idea and
with it gives the clue to that which we understand in the world—so misconstrued
by Kant—“Time.” It is incidental that the political situation of
“Hamlet,” the murder of the King and the succession question impinge upon
just that character that Hamlet is. Or, take Othello—it is incidental that the
man at whom Iago, the commonplace rogue that one could pick up in any
street, aims his blow is one whose person possesses just this wholly special
physiognomy. And Lear! Could anything be more incidental (and therefore
more “natural”) than the conjunction of this commanding dignity with these
fateful passions and the inheritance of them by the daughters? No one has even
to-day realized all the significance of the fact that Shakespeare took his stories
as he found them and <em>in the very finding of them</em> filled them with the force of inward
necessity, and never more sublimely so than in the case of the Roman
dramas. For the <em>will</em> to understand him has squandered itself in desperate
efforts to bring in a moral causality, a “therefore,” a connexion of “guilt”
and “expiation.” But all this is neither correct nor incorrect—these are
words that belong to the World-as-Nature and imply that something causal is
being judged—but <em>superficial</em>, shallow, that is, in contrast to the poet’s deep
subjectivizing of the mere fact-anecdote. Only one who feels this is able to
admire the grand naïveté of the entrances of Lear and Macbeth. Now, Hebbel
is the exact opposite, he destroys the depth of the anecdote by a system of cause
and effect. The arbitrary and abstract character of his plots, which everyone
feels instinctively, comes from the fact that the causal scheme of his spiritual
conflicts is in contradiction with the historically-motived world-feeling and the
quite other logic proper to that feeling. These people do not live, they <em>prove</em>
something by coming on. One feels the presence of a great understanding, not
that of a deep life. Instead of the Incident we get a Problem.</p>

<p class='c001'>Further, this <em>Western</em> species of the Incidental is entirely alien to the Classical
world-feeling and therefore to its drama. Antigone has no incidental character
to affect her fortunes in any way. What happened to Œdipus—unlike the
fate of Lear—might just as well have happened to anyone else. This is the
Classical “Destiny,” the <span lang="la"><i>Fatum</i></span> which is common to all mankind, which
affects the “body” and in no wise depends upon incidents of personality.</p>

<p class='c001'>The kind of history that is commonly written must, even if it does not lose
itself in compilation of data, come to a halt before the <em>superficially</em> incidental—that
is the ... destiny of its authors, who, spiritually, remain more or less in
the ruck. In their eyes nature and history mingle in a cheap unity, and incident
or accident, <span lang="fr">“sa sacrée majesté le Hazard,”</span> is for the man of the ruck the
easiest thing in the world to understand. For him the secret logic of history
‘which he does not feel’ is replaced by a causal that is only waiting behind the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>scene to come on and prove itself. It is entirely appropriate that the anecdotal
foreground of history should be the arena of all the scientific causality-hunters
and all the novelists and sketch-writers of the common stamp. How many
wars have been begun when they were because some jealous courtier wished to
remove some general from the proximity of his wife! How many battles have
been won and lost through ridiculous incidents! Only think how Roman
history was written in the 18th Century and how Chinese history is written
even to-day! Think of the Dey smacking the Consul with his fly-flap<a id='r159'></a><a href='#f159' class='c019'><sup>[159]</sup></a>
and other such incidents that enliven the historical scene with comic-opera
motives! Do not the deaths of Gustavus Adolphus and of Alexander seem like
expedients of a nonplussed playwright; Hannibal a simple intermezzo, a surprise
intrusion in Classical history; or Napoleon’s “transit” more or less of a
melodrama? Anyone who looks for the inner form of history in any causal
succession of its visible detail-events must always, if he is honest, find a comedy
of burlesque inconsequence, and I can well imagine that the dance-scene of the
drunken Triumvirs in “Antony and Cleopatra” (almost overlooked, but one
of the most powerful in that immensely deep work)<a id='r160'></a><a href='#f160' class='c019'><sup>[160]</sup></a> grew up out of the contempt
of the prince of <em>historical</em> tragedy for the pragmatic aspect of history.
For this is the aspect of it that has always dominated “the world,” and has
encouraged ambitious little men to interfere in it. It was because their eyes
were set on <em>this</em>, and its rationalistic structure, that Rousseau and Marx could
persuade themselves that they could alter the “course of the world” by a
theory. And even the social or economic interpretation of political developments,
to which present-day historical work is trying to rise as to a peak-ideal
(though its biological cast constantly leads us to suspect foundations of the
causal kind), is still exceedingly shallow and trivial.</p>

<p class='c001'>Napoleon had in his graver moments a strong feeling for the deep logic of
world-becoming, and in such moments could divine to what extent he <em>was</em>, and
to what extent he <em>had</em>, a destiny. “I feel myself driven towards an end that I
do not know. As soon as I shall have reached it, as soon as I shall become unnecessary,
an atom will suffice to shatter me. Till then, not all the forces of
mankind can do anything against me,” he said at the beginning of the Russian
campaign. Here, certainly, is not the thought of a pragmatist. In this moment
he divined how little the logic of Destiny needs particular instances, better
men or situations. Supposing that he himself, as “empirical person,” had fallen
at Marengo—then that which he <em>signified</em> would have been actualized in some
other form. A melody, in the hands of a great musician, is capable of a wealth
of variations; it can be entirely transformed so far as the simple listener is concerned
without altering itself—which is quite another matter—fundamentally.
The epoch of German national union accomplished itself through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>the person of Bismarck, that of the Wars of Freedom through broad and almost
nameless events; but either theme, to use the language of music, could have
been “worked out” in other ways. Bismarck might have been dismissed early,
the battle of Leipzig might have been lost, and for the group of wars 1864—1866—1870
there might have been substituted (as “modulations”) diplomatic, dynastic,
revolutionary or economic facts—though it must not be forgotten that
<em>Western history, under the pressure of its own physiognomic abundance</em> (as distinct from
physiognomic style, for even Indian history has that) <i>demands, so to say, contrapuntally
strong accents—wars or big personalities—at the decisive points</i>.
Bismarck himself points out in his reminiscences that in the spring of 1848
national unity could have been achieved on a broader base than in 1870 but for
the policy (more accurately, the personal taste) of the King of Prussia;<a id='r161'></a><a href='#f161' class='c019'><sup>[161]</sup></a> and
yet, again, according to Bismarck, this would have been so tame a working-out
that a coda of one sort or another (<span lang="it"><i>da capo e poi la coda</i></span>) would have been imperatively
necessary. Withal, the Theme—the meaning of the epoch—would
have been entirely unaltered by the facts assuming this or that shape. Goethe
might—possibly—have died young, but <em>not</em> his “idea.” Faust and Tasso
would not have been written, but they would have “been” in a deeply mysterious
sense, even though they lacked the poet’s elucidation.</p>

<p class='c001'>For if it is incidental that the history of higher mankind fulfils itself in the
form of great Cultures, and that one of these Cultures awoke in West Europe
about the year 1000; yet from the moment of awakening it is bound by its
charter. Within every epoch there is unlimited abundance of surprising and
unforeseeable possibilities of self-actualizing in detail-facts, but the epoch itself
is necessary, for the life-unity is in it. That its inner form is precisely what
it is, constitutes its specific determination (Bestimmung). Fresh incidentals
can affect the shape of its development, can make this grandiose or puny, prosperous
or sorrowful, but alter it they cannot. An irrevocable fact is not merely
a special case but a special type; thus in the history of the Universe we have the
type of the “solar system” of sun and circling planets; in the history of our
planet we have the type “life” with its youth, age, duration and reproduction;
in the history of “life” the type “humanity,” and in the world-historical
stage of that humanity the type of the great individual Culture.<a id='r162'></a><a href='#f162' class='c019'><sup>[162]</sup></a> And these
Cultures are essentially related to the plants, in that they are bound for the whole
duration of their life to the soil from which they sprang. Typical, lastly, is the
manner in which the men of a Culture understand and experience Destiny, however
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>differently the picture may be coloured for this individual and that; what
I say here about it is not “true,” but inwardly necessary for this Culture and
this time-phase of it, and if it convinces you, it is not because there is only one
“truth” but because you and I belong to the same epoch.</p>

<p class='c001'>For this reason, the Euclidean soul of the Classical Culture could only experience
its existence, bound as this was to present foregrounds, in the form of
<em>incidents of the Classical style</em>. If in respect of the Western soul we can regard
incident as a minor order of Destiny, in respect of the Classical soul it is just
the reverse. Destiny is incident become immense—that is the very signification
of Ananke, Heimarmene, Fatum. As the Classical soul did not genuinely
live through history, it possessed no genuine feeling for a <em>logic</em> of Destiny. We
must not be misled by words. The most popular goddess of Hellenism was
Tyche, whom the Greeks were practically unable to distinguish from Ananke.
But Incident and Destiny are felt by <em>us</em> with all the intensity of an opposition,
and on the issue of this opposition we feel that everything fundamental in our
existence depends. <em>Our</em> history is that of great connexions, Classical history—its
full actuality, that is, and not merely the image of it that we get in the
historian (e.g., Herodotus)—is that of anecdotes, of a series of plastic details.
The style of the Classical life generally, the style of every individual life within
it, is anecdotal, using the word with all seriousness. The sense-perceivable side
of events condenses on <em>anti-historical, daemonic, absurd</em> incidents; it is the denial
and disavowal of all logic of happening. The stories of the Classical master-tragedies
one and all <em>exhaust</em> themselves in incidents that mock at any meaning
of the world; they are the exact denotation of what is connoted by the word
εἱμαρμένη<a id='r163'></a><a href='#f163' class='c019'><sup>[163]</sup></a> in contrast to the Shakesperian <em>logic</em> of incident. Consider Œdipus
once more: that which happened to him was wholly extrinsic, was neither
brought about nor conditioned by anything subjective to himself, and could
just as well have happened to anyone else. This is the very <em>form of the Classical
myth</em>. Compare with it the necessity—inherent in and governed by the man’s
whole existence and the relation of that existence to Time—that resides in
the destiny of Othello, of Don Quixote, of Werther. It is, as we have said
before, the difference of situation-tragedy and character-tragedy. And this
opposition repeats itself in history proper—every epoch of the West has
character, while each epoch of the Classical only presents a situation. While
the life of Goethe was one of fate-filled logic, that of Cæsar was one of mythical
indidentalness, and it was left to Shakespeare to <em>introduce</em> logic into it. Napoleon
is a tragic character, Alcibiades fell into tragic situations. Astrology, in
the form in which from Gothic to Baroque the Western soul knew it—was
dominated by it even in denying it—was the attempt to master one’s <em>whole</em>
future life-course; the Faustian horoscope, of which the best-known example
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>is perhaps that drawn out for Wallenstein by Kepler, <em>presupposes</em> a steady and
purposeful direction in the existence that has yet to be accomplished. But the
Classical oracle, always consulted for the <em>individual</em> case, is the genuine symbol
of the meaningless incident and the moment; it accepts the point-formed and
the discontinuous as the elements of the world’s course, and oracle-utterances
were therefore entirely in place in that which was written and experienced as
history at Athens. Was there one single Greek who possessed the notion of a
historical <em>evolution</em> towards this or that or any aim? And <em>we</em>—should we have
been able to reflect upon history or to make it if we had <em>not</em> possessed it? If we
compare the destinies of Athens and of France at corresponding times after
Themistocles and Louis XIV, we cannot but feel that the style of the historical
feeling and the style of its actualization are always one. In France logic <em>à
outrance</em>, in Athens un-logic.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ultimate meaning of this significant fact can now be understood. History
is the actualizing of a soul, and the same style governs the history one
makes as governs the history one contemplates. The Classical mathematic
excludes the symbol of infinite space, and therefore the Classical history does
so too. It is not for nothing that the scene of Classical existence is the smallest
of any, the individual <em>Polis</em>, that it lacks horizon and perspective—notwithstanding
the episode of Alexander’s expedition<a id='r164'></a><a href='#f164' class='c019'><sup>[164]</sup></a>—just as the Attic stage cuts
them off with its flat back-wall, in obvious contrast to the long-range efficacy
of Western Cabinet diplomacy and the Western capital city. And just as the
Greeks and the Romans neither knew nor (with their fundamental abhorrence
of the Chaldean astronomy) would admit as actual any cosmos but that of the
foreground; just as at bottom their deities are house-gods, city-gods, field-gods
but never star-gods,<a id='r165'></a><a href='#f165' class='c019'><sup>[165]</sup></a> so also what they <em>depicted</em> was only foregrounds. Never in
Corinth or Athens or Sicyon do we find a landscape with mountain horizon and
driving clouds and distant towns; every vase-painting has the same constituents,
figures of Euclidean separateness and artistic self-sufficiency. Every pediment
or frieze group is serially and not contrapuntally built up. But then,
life-experience itself was one strictly of foregrounds. Destiny was not the
“course of life” but something upon which one suddenly stumbles. And this
is how Athens produced, with Polygnotus’s fresco and Plato’s geometry, <em>a
fate-tragedy</em> in which fate is precisely the fate that we discredit in Schiller’s
“Bride of Messina.” The complete unmeaning of blind doom that is embodied,
for instance, in the curse of the House of Atreus, served to reveal to the
ahistorical Classical soul the full meaning of its own world.</p>

<p class='c018'>We may now point our moral with a few examples, which, though hazardous,
ought not at this stage to be open to misunderstanding. Imagine Columbus
supported by France instead of by Spain, as was in fact highly probable at one
time. Had Francis I been the master of America, without doubt he and not
the Spaniard Charles V would have obtained the imperial crown. The early
Baroque period from the Sack of Rome to the Peace of Westphalia, which was
actually the <em>Spanish</em> century in religion, intellect, art, politics and manners,
would have been shaped from Paris and not from Madrid. Instead of the names
of Philip, Alva, Cervantes, Calderon, Velasquez we should be talking to-day of
great Frenchmen who in fact—if we may thus roundly express a very difficult
idea—remained unborn. The style of the Church which was definitively
fixed in this epoch by the Spaniard Loyola and the Council of Trent which he
spiritually dominated; the style of politics to which the war-technique of
Spanish captains, the diplomacy of Spanish cardinals and the courtly spirit of
the Escorial gave a stamp that lasted till the Congress of Vienna and in essential
points till beyond Bismarck; the architecture of the Baroque; the great age of
Painting; ceremonial and the polite society of the great cities—all these would
have been represented by other profound heads, noble and clerical, by wars
other than Philip II’s wars, by another architect than Vignola, by another
Court. The Incidental chose the Spanish gesture for the late period of the
West. But the <em>inward logic</em> of that age, which was <em>bound</em> to find its fulfilment
in the great Revolution (or some event of the same connotation), remained
intact.</p>

<p class='c001'>This French revolution might have been represented by some other event of
different form and occurring elsewhere, say in England or Germany. But its
“idea,”—which (as we shall see later) was the transition from Culture to
Civilization, the victory of the inorganic megalopolis over the organic countryside
which was henceforward to become spiritually “the provinces,”—was
necessary, and the moment of its occurrence was also necessary. To describe
such a moment we shall use the term (long blurred, or misused as a synonym
for period) <em>epoch</em>. When we say an event is epoch-making we mean that it
marks in the course of a Culture a necessary and fateful turning-point. The
merely incidental event, a crystallization-form of the historical surface, may
be represented by other appropriate incidents, but the <em>epoch</em> is necessary and
predeterminate. And it is evident that the question of whether, in respect of
a particular Culture and its course, an event ranks as an epoch or as an episode
is connected with its ideas of Destiny and Incidents, and therefore also with its
idea of the Tragic as “epochal” (as in the West) or as “episodic” (as in the
Classical world).</p>

<p class='c001'>We can, further, distinguish between <em>impersonal</em> or anonymous and <em>personal</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>epochs, according to their physiognomic type in the picture of history.
Amongst “incidents” of the first rank we include those great persons who are
endowed with such formative force that the destiny of thousands, of whole
peoples, and of ages, are incorporated in their private destinies; but at the same
time we can distinguish the adventurer or successful man who is destitute of
inward greatness (like Danton or Robespierre) from the Hero of history by
the fact that his personal destiny displays only the traits of the common
destiny. Certain names may ring, but “the Jacobins” collectively and not
individuals amongst them were the type that dominated the time. The first
part of this epoch of the Revolution is therefore thoroughly anonymous, just
as the second or Napoleonic is in the highest degree personal. In a few years
the immense force of these phenomena accomplished what the corresponding
epoch of the Classical (c. 386-322), fluid and unsure of itself, required decades of
undermining-work to achieve. It is of the essence of all Culture that at the outset
of each stage the same potentiality is present, and that necessity fulfils itself
thereafter either in the form of a great individual person (Alexander, Diocletian,
Mohammed, Luther, Napoleon) or in that of an almost anonymous happening
of powerful inward constitution (Peloponnesian War, Thirty Years’ War,
Spanish Succession War) or else in a feeble and indistinct evolution (periods of
the Diadochi and of the Hyksos, the Interregnum in Germany). And the
question which of these forms is the more likely to occur in any given instance,
is one that is influenced in advance by the historical and therefore also the
tragic style of the Culture concerned.<a id='r166'></a><a href='#f166' class='c019'><sup>[166]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The tragic in Napoleon’s life—which still awaits discovery by a poet great
enough to comprehend it and shape it—was that he, who rose into effective
being by fighting British policy and the British spirit which that policy so
eminently represented, completed by that very fighting the continental victory
of this spirit, which thereupon became strong enough, in the guise of “liberated
nations” to overpower him and to send him to St. Helena to die. It was
not Napoleon who originated the expansion principle. That had arisen out of
the Puritanism of Cromwell’s <span lang="fr"><i>milieu</i></span> which called into life the British Colonial
Empire.<a id='r167'></a><a href='#f167' class='c019'><sup>[167]</sup></a> Transmitted through the English-schooled intellects of Rousseau
and Mirabeau to the Revolutionary armies, of which English philosophical
ideas were essentially the driving force, it became their tendency even from that
day of Valmy which Goethe alone read aright. It was not Napoleon who
formed the idea, but the idea that formed Napoleon, and when he came to the
throne he was obliged to pursue it further against the only power, England
namely, whose purpose was <em>the same</em> as his own. His Empire was a creation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>French blood but of English style. It was in London, again, that Locke,
Shaftesbury, Samuel Clarke and, above all, Bentham built up the theory of
“European Civilization”—the Western Hellenism—which Bayle, Voltaire
and Rousseau carried to Paris. Thus it was in the name of <em>this</em> England of
Parliamentarianism, business morality and journalism that Valmy, Marengo,
Jena, Smolensk and Leipzig were fought, and in <em>all</em> these battles it was the
English spirit that defeated the French Culture of the West.<a id='r168'></a><a href='#f168' class='c019'><sup>[168]</sup></a> The First Consul
had no intention of incorporating West Europe in France; his primary object
was—note the Alexander-idea on the threshold of every Civilization!—to
replace the British Colonial Empire by a French one. Thereby, French preponderance
in the Western culture-region would have been placed on a practically
unassailable foundation; it would have been the Empire of Charles V on
which the sun never set, but managed from Paris after all, in spite of Columbus
and Philip, and organized as an economic-military instead of as an ecclesiastical-chivalric
unit. So far-reaching, probably, was the destiny that was in Napoleon.
But the Peace of Paris in 1763 had already decided the question <em>against</em>
France, and Napoleon’s great plans time and again came to grief in petty incidents.
At Acre a few guns were landed in the nick of time from the British
warships: there was a moment, again, just before the signature of the Peace of
Amiens, when the whole Mississippi basin was still amongst his assets and he
was in close touch with the Maratha powers that were resisting British progress
in India; but again a minor naval incident<a id='r169'></a><a href='#f169' class='c019'><sup>[169]</sup></a> obliged him to abandon the
whole of a carefully-prepared enterprise: and, lastly, when by the occupation
of Dalmatia, Corfu and all Italy he had made the Adriatic a French lake,
with a view to another expedition to the East, and was negotiating with the
Shah of Persia for action against India, he was defeated by the whims of the
Tsar Alexander, who at times was undoubtedly willing to support a march on
India and whose aid would infallibly have secured its success. It was only after
the failure of all extra-European combinations that he chose, as his <span lang="la"><i>ultima ratio</i></span>
in the battle against England, the incorporation of Germany and Spain, and so,
raising against himself <em>his own</em> English-Revolutionary ideas, the very ideas of
which he had been the vehicle,<a id='r170'></a><a href='#f170' class='c019'><sup>[170]</sup></a> he took the step that made him “no longer
necessary.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>At one time it falls to the Spanish spirit to outline, at another to the
British or the French to remould, the world-embracing colonial system. A
“United States of Europe,” actualized through Napoleon as founder of a
romantic and popular military monarchy, is the analogue of the Realm of the
Diadochi; actualized as a 21st-Century economic organism by a matter-of-fact
Cæsar, it is the counterpart of the <span lang="la"><i>imperium Romanum</i></span>. These are incidentals,
but they are in the picture of history. But Napoleon’s victories and defeats
(which always hide a victory of England and Civilization over Culture), his
Imperial dignity, his fall, the <span lang="fr"><i>Grande Nation</i></span>, the episodic liberation of Italy
(in 1796, as in 1859, essentially no more than a change of political costume for
a people long since become insignificant), the destruction of the Gothic ruin
of the Roman-German Empire, are mere surface phenomena, behind which is
marching the great logic of genuine and invisible History, and it was in the
sense of this logic that the West, having fulfilled its French-formed Culture in
the <span lang="fr"><i>ancien régime</i></span>, closed it off with the English Civilization. As symbols of
“contemporary” epochal moments, then, the storming of the Bastille, Valmy,
Austerlitz, Waterloo and the rise of Prussia correspond to the Classical-history
facts of Chæronea, Gaugamela (Arbela), Alexander’s Indian expedition and the
Roman victory of Sentinum.<a id='r171'></a><a href='#f171' class='c019'><sup>[171]</sup></a> And we begin to understand that in wars and
political catastrophies—the chief material of our historical writings—victory
is not the essence of the fight nor peace the aim of a revolution.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>X</h3>

<p class='c018'>Anyone who has absorbed these ideas will have no difficulty in understanding
how the causality principle is bound to have a fatal effect upon the capacity
for genuinely experiencing History when, at last, it attains its rigid form in
that “late” condition of a Culture to which it is proper and in which it is able
to tyrannize over the world-picture. Kant, very wisely, established causality as
a necessary form of knowledge, and it cannot be too often emphasized that this
was meant to refer exclusively to the understanding of man’s environment by
the way of reason. But while the word “necessary” was accepted readily
enough, it has been overlooked that this limitation of the principle to a single
domain of knowledge is just what forbids its application to the contemplation
and experiencing of living history. Man-knowing and Nature-knowing are in
essence entirely incapable of being compared, but nevertheless the whole Nineteenth
Century was at great pains to abolish the frontier between Nature and
History in favour of the former. The more historically men tried to think, the
more they forgot that in this domain they ought <em>not</em> to think. In forcing the
rigid scheme of a spatial and anti-temporal relation of cause and effect upon
something alive, they disfigured the visible face of becoming with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>construction-lines of a physical nature-picture, and, habituated to their own
late, megalopolitan and causally-thinking <span lang="fr"><i>milieu</i></span>, they were unconscious of the
fundamental absurdity of a science that sought to understand an organic becoming
by methodically misunderstanding it as the <em>machinery</em> of the thing-become.
Day is not the cause of night, nor youth of age, nor blossom of fruit.
Everything that we grasp intellectually has a <em>cause</em>, everything that we live
organically with inward certitude has a <em>past</em>. The one recognizes the <em>case</em>, that
which is generally possible and has a fixed inner form which is the same whenever
and wherever and however often it occurs, the other recognizes the <em>event</em>
which once was and will never recur. And, according as we grasp something
in our envelope-world critically and consciously or physiognomically and involuntarily,
we draw our conclusion from technical or from living experience,
and we relate it to a timeless cause in space or to a direction which leads from
yesterday to to-day and to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the spirit of our great cities <em>refuses</em> to be involuntary. Surrounded by a
machine-technique that it has itself created in surprising Nature’s most dangerous
secret, the “law,” it seeks to conquer history also technically, “theoretically
and practically.” “Usefulness,” suitableness to purpose (Zweckmässigkeit), is
the great word which assimilates the one to the other. A materialist conception
of history, ruled by laws of causal Nature, leads to the setting up of usefulness-ideals
such as “enlightenment,” “humanity,” “world-peace,” as aims of
world-history, to be reached by the “march of progress.” But in these schemes
of old age the feeling of Destiny has died, and with it the young reckless courage
that, self-forgetful and big with a future, presses on to meet a dark decision.</p>

<p class='c001'>For only youth has a future, and <em>is</em> Future, that enigmatic synonym of
directional Time and of Destiny. <em>Destiny is always young.</em> He who replaces it
by a mere chain of causes and effects, sees even in the not-yet-actualized something,
as it were, old and past—<em>direction</em> is wanting. But he who lives towards
a something in the superabundant flow of things need not concern himself with
aims and abilities, for he feels that he himself is the meaning of what is to
happen. This was the faith in the Star that never left Cæsar nor Napoleon nor
the great doers of another kind; and this it is that lies deepest of all—youthful
melancholy notwithstanding—in every childhood and in every young clan,
people, Culture, that extends forward over all their history for men of act and
of vision, who are young however white their hair, younger even than the
most juvenile of those who look to a timeless utilitarianism. The feeling of
a significance in the momentarily present world-around discloses itself in the
earliest days of childhood, when it is still only the persons and things of the
nearest environment that essentially exist, and develops through silent and unconscious
experience into a comprehensive picture. This picture constitutes the
general expression of the whole Culture as it is at the particular stage, and it is
only the fine judge of life and the deep searcher of history who can interpret it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>At this point a distinction presents itself between the <em>immediate impression</em>
of the present and the <em>image</em> of the past that is only presented in the spirit, in
other words between the world as happening and the world as history. The
eye of the man of action (statesman and general) appreciates the first, that of
the man of contemplation (historian and poet) the second. Into the first one
plunges practically to do or to suffer; chronology,<a id='r172'></a><a href='#f172' class='c019'><sup>[172]</sup></a> that great symbol of irrevocable
past, claims the second. We look backwards, and we live forward
towards the unforeseen, but even in childhood our <em>technical</em> experience soon
introduces into the image of the singular occurrence elements of the foreseeable,
that is, an image of regulated Nature which is subject not to physiognomic fact
but to calculation. We apprehend a “head of game” as a living entity and
immediately afterwards as food; we see a flash of lightning as a peril and then
as an electrical discharge. And this second, later, petrifying projection of the
world more and more tends to overpower the first in the Megalopolis; the
image of the past is mechanized and materialized and from it is deduced a set
of causal rules for present and future. We come to believe in historical laws
and in a rational understanding of them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nevertheless science is always natural science. Causal knowledge and
technical experience refer only to the become, the extended, the comprehended.
As life is to history, so is knowledge (Wissen) to Nature, viz., to the sensible
world apprehended as an element, treated as in space and subjected to the law
of cause and effect. Is there, then, a science of History at all? To answer this
question, let us remember that in every personal world-picture, which only
approximates more or less to the ideal picture, there is both something of
Nature and something of History. No Nature is without living, and no History
without causal, <em>harmonies</em>. For within the sphere of Nature, although
two like experiments, conformably to law, have the like result, yet each of
these experiments is a historical event possessing a date and not recurring.
And within that of History, the dates or data of the past (chronologies, statistics,
names, forms<a id='r173'></a><a href='#f173' class='c019'><sup>[173]</sup></a>) form a rigid web. “Facts are facts” even if we are
unaware of them, and all else is image, <span lang="la"><i>Theoria</i></span>, both in the one domain and
in the other. But history is itself the condition of being “in the focus” and
the material is only an aid to this condition, whereas in Nature the real aim
is the winning of the material, and theory is only the servant of this purpose.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is, therefore, not a science <em>of</em> history but an ancillary science <em>for</em> history,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>which ascertains that which has been. For the historical outlook itself
the data are always symbols. Scientific research, on the contrary, is science
and only science. In virtue of its technical origin and purpose it sets out to
find data and laws of the causal sort and nothing else, and from the moment
that it turns its glance upon something else it becomes <em>Metaphysics</em>, something
trans-scientific. And just because this is so, historical and natural-science data
are different. The latter consistently repeat themselves, the former never.
The latter are <em>truths</em>, the former <em>facts</em>. However closely related incidentals and
causals may appear to be in the everyday picture, fundamentally they belong
to different worlds. As it is beyond question that the shallowness of a man’s
history-picture (the man himself, therefore) is in proportion to the dominance
in it of frank incidentals, so it is beyond question that the emptiness of written
history is in proportion to the degree in which it makes the establishment of
purely factual relations its object. The more deeply a man lives History, the
more rarely will he receive “causal” impressions and the more surely will he
be sensible of their utter insignificance. If the reader examines Goethe’s writings
in natural science, he will be astounded to find how “living nature” can
be set forth without formulas, without laws, almost without a trace of the
causal. For him, Time is not a distance but a feeling. But the experience of
last and deepest things is practically denied to the ordinary savant who dissects
and arranges purely critically and allows himself neither to contemplate nor to
feel. In the case of History, on the contrary, this power of experience is <em>the</em>
requisite. And thus is justified the paradox that the less a historical researcher
has to do with real science, the better it is for his history.</p>

<p class='c018'>Is it permissible to fix upon one, any one, group of social, religious, physiological
or ethical facts as the “cause” of another? “Certainly,” the rationalistic
school of history, and still more the up-to-date sociology, would reply.
That, they would say, is what is meant by our comprehending history and
deepening our knowledge of it. But in reality, with “civilized” man there is
always the implicit postulate of an underlying <em>rational</em> purpose—without
which indeed his world would be meaningless. And there is something rather
comic in the most unscientific freedom that he allows himself in his <em>choice</em> of his
fundamental causes. One man selects this, another that, group as <span lang="la"><i>prima causa</i></span>—an
inexhaustible source of polemics—and all fill their works with pretended
elucidations of the “course of history” on natural-science lines. Schiller has
given us the classical expression of this method in one of his immortal banalities,
the verse in which the <span lang="de">“Weltgetriebe”</span> is stat <span lang="de">“durch
Hunger und durch Liebe”</span>; and the Nineteenth Century, progressing from
Rationalism to Materialism, has made this opinion canonical. The cult of the
useful was set up on high. To it Darwin, in the name of his century, sacrificed
Goethe’s Nature-theory. The organic logic of the facts of life was supplanted
by a mechanics in physiological garb. Heredity, adaptation, natural selection,
are utility-causes of purely mechanical connotation. The historical <em>dispensations</em>
were superseded by a naturalistic <em>movement</em> “in space.” (But <em>are there</em>
historical or spiritual “processes,” or life-“processes” of any sort whatever?
Have historical “movements” such as, for example, the Renaissance or the
Age of Enlightenment anything whatever to do with the scientific notion of
movement?) The word “process” eliminated Destiny and unveiled the secret
of becoming, and lo! there was no longer a tragic but only an exact mathematical
structure of world-happening. And thereupon the “exact” historian
enunciated the proposition that in the history-picture we had before us a sequence
of “states” of mechanical type which were amenable to rational analysis
like a physical experiment or a chemical reaction, and that therefore causes,
means, methods and objects were capable of being grouped together as a comprehensible
system on the visible surface. It all becomes astonishingly simple.
And one is bound to admit that given a sufficiently shallow observer, the
hypothesis (so far as concerns <em>his</em> personality and its world-picture) comes off.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hunger and Love<a id='r174'></a><a href='#f174' class='c019'><sup>[174]</sup></a> thus become mechanical causes of mechanical processes
in the “life of peoples.” Social problems and sexual problems (both belonging
to a “physics” or “chemistry” of public—all-too-public—existence) become
the obvious themes of utilitarian history and <em>therefore of the corresponding
tragedy</em>. For the social drama necessarily accompanies the materialist treatment
of history, and that which in Goethe’s <span lang="de">“Wahlverwandtschaften”</span> was destiny
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>in the highest sense has become in Ibsen’s “Lady from the Sea” nothing but a
sexual problem. Ibsen and all the reason-poets of our great cities build—build
from their very first causes to their very last effect—but they do not sing. As
artist, Hebbel fought hard to overcome this merely prosaic element in his more
critical than intuitive temperament, to be a poet <span lang="fr"><i>quand même</i></span>, hence his desperate
and wholly un-Goethean effort to <em>motive</em> his events. In Hebbel, as
in Ibsen, motiving means trying to shape tragedy <em>causally</em>, and he dissected and
re-dissected and transformed and retransformed his Anecdote until he had made
it into a system that proved a case. Consider his treatment of the Judith story—Shakespeare
would have taken it as it was, and scented a world-secret in the
physiognomic charm of the pure adventure. But Goethe’s warning: “Do not,
I beg you, look for anything behind phenomena. <em>They are themselves their own
lesson</em> (sie selbst sind die Lehre)” had become incomprehensible to the century
of Marx and Darwin. The idea of trying to read a destiny in the physiognomy
of the past and that of trying to represent unadulterated Destiny as a tragedy
were equally remote from them. In both domains, the cult of the useful had
set before itself an entirely different aim. Shapes were called into being, not to
be, but to prove something. “Questions” of the day were “treated,” social
problems suitably “solved,” and the stage, like the history-book, became a
means to that end. Darwinism, however unconscious of what it was doing,
has made biology politically effective. Somehow or other, democratic stirrings
happened in the protoplasm, and the struggle for existence of the rain-worms
is a useful lesson for the bipeds who have scraped through.</p>

<p class='c001'>With all this, the historians have failed to learn the lesson that our ripest
and strictest science, Physics, would have taught them, the lesson of prudence.
Even if we concede them their causal method, the superficiality with which
they apply it is an outrage. There is neither the intellectual discipline nor the
keen sight, let alone the scepticism that is inherent in our handling of physical
hypotheses.<a id='r175'></a><a href='#f175' class='c019'><sup>[175]</sup></a> For the attitude of the physicist to his atoms, electrons, currents,
and fields of force, to æther and mass, is very far removed from the naïve faith
of the layman and the Monist in these things. They are <em>images</em> which he subjects
to the abstract relationships of his differential equations, in which he
clothes trans-phenomenal numbers, and if he allows himself a certain freedom
to choose amongst several theories, it is because he does not try to find in them
any actuality but that of the “conventional sign.”<a id='r176'></a><a href='#f176' class='c019'><sup>[176]</sup></a> He knows, too, that over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>and above an experimental acquaintance with the technical structure of the
world-around, all that it is possible to achieve by this process (which is the
only one open to natural science) is a symbolic interpretation of it, no more—certainly
not “Knowledge” in the sanguine popular sense. For, the image of
Nature being a creation and copy of the Intellect, its “alter ego” in the domain
of the extended, to <em>know</em> Nature means to know oneself.</p>

<p class='c001'>If Physics is the maturest of our sciences, Biology, whose business is to
explore the picture of organic life, is in point both of content and of methods the
weakest. What historical investigation <em>really</em> is, namely pure Physiognomic,
cannot be better illustrated than by the course of Goethe’s nature-studies.
He works upon mineralogy, and at once his views fit themselves together into
a conspectus of an earth-history in which his beloved granite signifies nearly
the same as that which I call the proto-human signifies in man’s history.
He investigates well-known plants, and the prime phenomenon of metamorphosis,
the original form of the history of all plant existence, reveals itself;
proceeding further, he reaches those extraordinarily deep ideas of vertical and
spiral tendencies in vegetation which have not been fully grasped even yet.
His studies of ossature, based entirely on the contemplation of life, lead him to
the discovery of the <span lang="la">“os intermaxillare”</span> in man and to the view that the
skull-structure of the vertebrates developed out of six vertebræ. Never is
there a word of causality. He feels the necessity of Destiny just as he himself
expressed it in his <span lang="de"><cite>Orphische Urworte</cite></span>:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c025'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“So must thou be. Thou canst not Self escape.</div>
      <div class='line'>So erst the Sibyls, so the Prophets told.</div>
      <div class='line'>Nor Time nor any Power can mar the shape</div>
      <div class='line'>Impressed, that living must itself unfold.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The mere chemistry of the stars, the mathematical side of physical observations,
and physiology proper interested him, the great historian of Nature
very little, because they belonged to Systematic and were concerned with experiential
learning of the become, the dead, and the rigid. This is what underlies
his anti-Newton polemic—a case in which, it must be added, both sides
were in the right, for the one had “knowledge” of the regulated nature-process
in the dead colour<a id='r177'></a><a href='#f177' class='c019'><sup>[177]</sup></a> while the experiencing of the other, the artist, was intuitive-sensuous
“feeling.” Here we have the two worlds in plain opposition; and
now therefore the essentials of their opposition must be stated with all strictness.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>History carries the mark of the <em>singular-factual</em>, Nature that of the <em>continuously
possible</em>. So long as I scrutinize the image of the world-around in order
to see by what laws it <em>must</em> actualize itself, irrespective of whether it does
happen or merely might happen—irrespective, that is, of time—then I am
working in a genuine science. For the necessity of a nature-law (and there are
no other laws) it is utterly immaterial whether it becomes phenomenal infinitely
often or never. <em>That is, it is independent of Destiny.</em> There are thousands
of chemical combinations that never are and never will be produced, but they
are demonstrably possible and therefore they <em>exist</em>—for the fixed System of
Nature though not for the Physiognomy of the whirling universe. A system
consists of truths, a history rests on facts. Facts follow one another, truths
follow <em>from</em> one another, and this is the difference between “when” and
“how.” That there has been a flash of lightning is a fact and can be indicated,
without a word, by the pointing of a finger. “When there is lightning there is
thunder,” on the contrary, is something that must be communicated by a
proposition or sentence. Experience-lived may be quite wordless, while systematic
knowing can only be through words. “Only that which has no
history is capable of being defined,” says Nietzsche somewhere. But History
is present becoming that tends into the future and looks back on the past.
Nature stands beyond all time, its mark is extension, and it is without directional
quality. Hence, for the one, the necessity of the mathematical, and
for the other the necessity of the tragic.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the actuality of waking existence both worlds, that of scrutiny and that of
acceptance (Hingebung), are interwoven, just as in a Brabant tapestry warp and
woof together effect the picture. Every law must, to be <em>available</em> to the understanding
at all, once have been discovered through some destiny-disposition
in the history of an intellect—that is, it must have once been in experiential
life; and every destiny appears in some sensible garb—as persons, acts, scenes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>and gestures—in which Nature-laws are operative. Primitive life is submissive
before the daemonic unity of the fateful; in the consciousness of the mature Culture
this “early” world-image is incessantly in conflict with the other, “late,”
world-image; and in the civilized man the tragic world-feeling succumbs to the
mechanizing intellect. History and nature <em>within ourselves</em> stand opposed to one
another as <em>life</em> is to <em>death</em>, as <em>ever-becoming time</em> to <em>ever-become space</em>. In the waking
consciousness, becoming and become struggle for control of the world-picture,
and the highest and maturest forms of both sorts (possible only for the great
Cultures) are seen, in the case of the Classical soul, in the opposition of Plato
and Aristotle, and, in the case of our Western, in that of Goethe and Kant—the
pure physiognomy of the world contemplated by the soul of an eternal
child, and its pure system comprehended by the reason of an eternal greybeard.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>XII</h4>

<p class='c018'>Herein, then, I see the <em>last</em> great task of Western philosophy, the only one
which still remains in store for the aged wisdom of the Faustian Culture, the
preordained issue, it seems, of our centuries of spiritual evolution. No Culture
is at liberty to <em>choose</em> the path and conduct of its thought, but here for the first
time a Culture can foresee the way that destiny has chosen for it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Before my eyes there seems to emerge, as a vision, a hitherto unimagined
mode of superlative historical research that is truly Western, necessarily alien
to the Classical and to every other soul but ours—a comprehensive Physiognomic
of all existence, a morphology of becoming for <em>all</em> humanity that
drives onward to the highest and last ideas; a duty of penetrating the world-feeling
not only of our proper soul but of all souls whatsoever that have contained
grand possibilities and have expressed them in the field of actuality as
grand Cultures. This philosophic view—to which we and we alone are
entitled in virtue of our analytical mathematic, our contrapuntal music and our
perspective painting—in that its scope far transcends the scheme of the systematist,
presupposes the eye of an artist, and of an artist who can feel the whole
sensible and apprehensible environment dissolve into a deep infinity of mysterious
relationships. So Dante felt, and so Goethe felt. To bring up, out of
the web of world-happening, a millennium of organic culture-history as an
entity and person, and to grasp the conditions of its inmost spirituality—such
is the aim. Just as one penetrates the lineaments of a Rembrandt portrait or a
Cæsar-bust, so the new art will contemplate and understand the grand, fateful
lines in the visage of a Culture as a superlative human individuality.</p>

<p class='c001'>To attempt the interpretation of a poet or a prophet, a thinker or a conqueror,
is of course nothing new, but to enter a culture-soul—Classical, Egyptian
or Arabian—so intimately as to absorb into one’s self, to make part of
one’s own life, the totality expressed by typical men and situations, by religion
and polity, by style and tendency, by thought and customs, is quite a new manner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>of experiencing life. Every epoch, every great figure, every deity, the cities,
the tongues, the nations, the arts, in a word everything that ever existed and
will become existent, are physiognomic traits of high symbolic significance
that it will be the business of quite a new kind of “judge of men” (Menschenkenner)
to interpret. Poems and battles, Isis and Cybele, festivals and Roman
Catholic masses, blast furnaces and gladiatorial games, dervishes and Darwinians,
railways and Roman roads, “Progress” and Nirvana, newspapers,
mass-slavery, money, machinery—all these are equally signs and symbols in
the world-picture of the past that the soul presents to itself and would interpret.
"<span lang="de"><i>Alles Vergängliche ist nur ein Gleichnis.</i></span>" Solutions and panoramas as yet unimagined
await the unveiling. Light will be thrown on the dark questions
which underlie dread and longing—those deepest of primitive human feelings—and
which the will-to-know has clothed in the “problems” of time, necessity,
space, love, death, and first causes. There is a wondrous music of the
spheres which <em>wills to be heard</em> and which a few of our deepest spirits will hear.
The physiognomic of world-happening will become the <em>last Faustian philosophy</em>.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>I</h4>

<p class='c018'>The notion of a world-history of physiognomic type expands itself therefore
into the wider idea of an <em>all-embracing symbolism</em>. Historical research, in the
sense that we postulate here, has simply to investigate the picture of the once-living
past and to determine its inner form and logic, and the Destiny-idea is the
furthest limit to which it can penetrate. But this research, however comprehensive
the new orientation tends to make it, cannot be more than a fragment and
a foundation of a still wider treatment. Parallel with it, we have a Nature-investigation
that is equally fragmentary and is limited to its own causal system of
relations. But neither tragic nor technical “motion” (if we may distinguish
by these words the respective bases of the lived and the known) exhausts the
living itself. We both live and know when we are awake, but, in addition, we
live when mind and senses are asleep. Though night may close every eye, the
blood does not sleep. We are moving in the moving (so at least we try to indicate,
by a word borrowed from science, the inexpressible that in sleep-hours we
feel with inward certainty). But it is only in the waking existence that “here”
and “there” appear as an irreducible duality. Every impulse proper to oneself
has an expression and every impulse alien to oneself makes an impression. And
thus everything of which we are conscious, whatever the form in which it is apprehended—“soul”
and “world,” or life and actuality, or History and Nature,
or law and feeling, Destiny or God, past and future or present and eternity—has
for us a deeper meaning still, a final meaning. And the one and only means
of rendering this incomprehensible comprehensible must be a kind of metaphysics
which regards <em>everything whatsoever</em> as having significance as a <em>symbol</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Symbols are sensible signs, final, indivisible and, above all, unsought impressions
of definite meaning. A symbol is a trait of actuality that for the
sensuously-alert man has an immediate and inwardly-sure significance, and that
is incommunicable by process of reason. The detail of a Doric or Early-Arabic
or Early-Romanesque ornament; the forms of the cottage and the family, of
intercourse, of costume and rite; the aspect, gait and mien of a man and of whole
classes of peoples and men; the communication-and community-forms of man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>and beast; and beyond all this the whole voiceless language of Nature with her
woods and pastures, flocks, clouds, stars, moonlight and thunderstorm, bloom
and decay, nearness and distance—all this is the emblematical impression of
the Cosmos upon us, who are both aware and in our reflective hours quite
capable of listening to this language. Vice versa, it is the sense of a homogeneous
understanding that raises up the family, the class, the tribe, or finally the
Culture, out of the general humanity and assembles it as such.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here, then, we shall not be concerned with what a world “is,” but with
what it signifies to the being that it envelops. When we wake up, at once
something extends itself between a “here” and a “there.” We live the “here”
as something proper, we experience the “there” as something alien. There is
a dualizing of soul and world as poles of actuality; and in the latter there are
both resistances which we grasp causally as things and properties, and impulses
in which we feel beings, <span lang="la"><i>numina</i></span> (“just like ourselves”) to be operative. But
there is in it, further, something which, as it were, eliminates the duality.
Actuality—the world <em>in relation to</em> a soul—is for every individual the projection
of the Directed upon the domain of the Extended—the Proper mirroring
itself on the Alien; one’s <em>actuality then signifies oneself</em>. By an act that is
both creative and unconscious—for it is not “I” who actualize the possible,
but “it” actualizes itself through me—the bridge of symbol is thrown between
the living “here” and “there.” Suddenly, necessarily, and completely
“the” world comes into being out of the totality of received and remembered
elements: and as it is an individual who apprehends the world, there is for each
individual a singular world.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are therefore as many worlds as there are waking beings and like-living,
like-feeling groups of beings. The supposedly single, independent and
external world that each believes to be common to all is really an ever-new,
uniquely-occurring and non-recurring experience in the existence of each.</p>

<p class='c001'>A whole series of grades of consciousness leads up from the root-beginnings
of obscure childish intuition, in which there is still no clear world for a soul
or self-conscious soul within a world, to the highly intellectualized states of
which only the men of fully-ripened civilizations are capable. This gradation
is at the same time an expansion of symbolism from the stage in which there is
an inclusive meaning of <em>all</em> things to one in which separate and specific signs
are distinguished. It is not merely when, after the manner of the child, the
dreamer and the artist, I am passive to a world full of dark significances; or
when I am awake without being in a condition of extreme alertness of thought
and act (such a condition is much rarer even in the consciousness of the real
thinker and man of action than is generally supposed)—it is continuously
and always, for as long as my life can be considered to be a waking life at all,
that I am endowing that which is outside me with the <em>whole</em> content that is in
me, from the half-dreamy impressions of world-coherence to the rigid world of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>causal laws and number that overlies and binds them. And even in the domain
of pure number the symbolical is not lacking, for we find that refined <em>thought</em>
puts inexpressible meanings into signs like the triangle, the circle and the
numbers 7 and 12.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is the <em>idea of the Macrocosm, actuality as the sum total of all symbols in relation
to one soul</em>. From this property of being significant nothing is exempt. All
that is, symbolizes. From the corporeal phenomena like visage, shape, mien
(of individuals and classes and peoples alike), which have always been known
to possess meaning, to the supposedly eternal and universally-valid forms of
knowledge, mathematics and physics, everything speaks out of the essence of
one and only one soul.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the same time these individuals’ worlds as lived and experienced by men
of <em>one</em> Culture or spiritual community are interrelated, and on the greater or
less degree of this interrelation depends the greater or less communicability of
intuitions, sensations and thoughts from one to another—that is, the possibility
of making intelligible what one has created in the style of one’s own
being, through expression-media such as language or art or religion, by means
of word-sounds or formulæ or signs that are themselves also symbols. The
degree of interrelation between one’s world and another’s fixes the limit at
which understanding becomes self-deception. Certainly it is only very imperfectly
that we can understand the Indian or the Egyptian soul, as manifested
in the men, customs, deities, root-words, ideas, buildings and acts of it. The
Greeks, ahistoric as they were, could not even guess at the essence of alien
spiritualities—witness the naïveté with which they were wont to rediscover
their own gods and Culture in those of alien peoples. But in our own case too,
the current translations of the ἀρχή, or <em>Atman</em>, or <em>Tao</em> of alien philosophers
presuppose our proper world-feeling, which is that from which our “equivalents”
claim their significance, as the basis of an alien soul-expression. And
similarly we elucidate the characters of early Egyptian and Chinese portraits
with reference to our own life-experience. In both cases we deceive ourselves.
That the artistic masterpieces of all Cultures are still living for us—“immortal”
as we say—is another such fancy, kept alive by the unanimity with
which we understand the alien work in the proper sense. Of this tendency of
ours the effect of the Laocoön group on Renaissance sculpture and that of Seneca
on the Classicist drama of the French are examples.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>II</h4>

<p class='c018'>Symbols, as being things actualized, belong to the domain of the extended.
They are become and not becoming (although they may stand for a becoming)
and they are therefore rigidly limited and subject to the laws of space. There
are <em>only</em> sensible-spatial symbols. The very word “form” designates something
extended in the extended,—even the inner forms of music are no exception,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>as we shall see. But extension is the hall-mark of the fact “waking consciousness,”
and this constitutes only one side of the individual existence and is
intimately bound up with that existence’s destinies. Consequently, every trait
of the actual waking-consciousness, whether it be feeling or understanding, is
in the moment of our becoming aware of it, already <em>past</em>. We can only <em>reflect</em>
upon impressions, “think them over” as our happy phrase goes, but that which
for the sensuous life of the animals is <em>past</em>, is for the grammatical (wortgebundene)
understanding of man <em>passing</em>, <em>transient</em>. That which happens is, of
course, transient, for a happening is irrevocable, but every kind of significance
is also transient. Follow out the destiny of the Column, from the Egyptian
tomb-temple in which columns are ranked to mark the path for the traveller,
through the Doric peripteros in which they are held together by the body of
the building, and the Early-Arabian basilica where they support the interior,
to the façades of the Renaissance in which they provide the upward-striving
element. As we see, an old significance never returns; that which has entered
the domain of extension has begun and ended at once. A deep relation, and
one which is early felt, exists <em>between space and death</em>. Man is the only being
that knows death; all others become old, but with a consciousness wholly
limited to the moment which must seem to them eternal. They live, but like
children in those first years in which Christianity regards them as still “innocent,”
they know nothing of life, and they die and they see death without
knowing anything about it. Only fully-awakened man, man proper, whose
understanding has been emancipated by the habit of language from dependence
on sight, comes to possess (besides sensibility) the <em>notion</em> of transience, that is,
a memory of the past as past and an experiential conviction of irrevocability.
We <em>are</em> Time,<a id='r178'></a><a href='#f178' class='c019'><sup>[178]</sup></a> but we <em>possess</em> also an image of history and in this image death,
and with death birth, appear as the two riddles. For all other beings life
pursues its course without suspecting its limits, i.e., without conscious knowledge
of task, meaning, duration and object. It is because there is this deep and
significant identity that we so often find the awakening of the inner life in a
child associated with the death of some relation. The child <em>suddenly</em> grasps the
lifeless corpse for what it is, something that has become wholly matter, wholly
space, and at the same moment it feels itself as an individual <em>being</em> in an alien
extended world. “From the child of five to myself is but a step. But from
the new-born baby to the child of five is an appalling distance,” said Tolstoi
once. Here, in the decisive moments of existence, when man first becomes man
and realizes his immense loneliness in the universal, the world-fear reveals
itself for the first time as the essentially human fear in the presence of death,
the limit of the light-world, rigid space. Here, too, the higher thought originates
as meditation upon death. Every religion, every scientific investigation,
every philosophy proceeds from it. Every great symbolism attaches its form-language
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>to the cult of the dead, the forms of disposal of the dead, the
adornment of the graves of the dead. The Egyptian style begins with the
tomb-temples of the Pharaohs, the Classical with the geometrical decoration
of the funerary urns, the Arabian with catacomb and sarcophagus, the Western
with the cathedral wherein the sacrificial death of Jesus is re-enacted daily
under the hands of the priest. From this primitive fear springs, too, historical
sensitiveness in all its modes, the Classical with its cleaving to the life-abundant
present, the Arabian with its baptismal rite that wins new life and overcomes
death, the Faustian with its contrition that makes worthy to receive the
Body of Jesus and therewith immortality. Till we have the constantly-wakeful
concern for the life that is <i>not yet past</i>, there is no concern for that which <em>is past</em>.
The beast has only the future, but man knows also the past. And thus every
new Culture is awakened in and with a new view of the world, that is, a sudden
glimpse of death as the secret of the perceivable world. It was when the idea of
the impending end of the world spread over Western Europe (about the year
1000) that the Faustian soul of this religion was born.</p>

<p class='c001'>Primitive man, in his deep amazement before death, sought with all the
forces of his spirit to penetrate and to spellbind this world of the extended with
the inexorable and always present limits of its causality, this world filled with
dark almightiness that continuously threatened to make an end of him. This
energetic defensive lies deep in unconscious existence, but, as being the first
impulse that genuinely projects soul and world as parted and opposed, it marks
the threshold of <i>personal</i> conduct of life. Ego-feeling and world-feeling begin
to work, and all culture, inner or outer, bearing or performance, is as a whole
only the intensification of this being-human. Henceforward all that resists
our sensations is not mere resistance or thing or impression, as it is for animals
and for children also, but an expression as well. Not merely are things actually
contained in the world-around but also they possess <em>meaning</em>, as phenomena in
the world-<em>view</em>. Originally they possessed only a relationship to men, but now
there is also a relationship of men to them. They have become emblems of
his existence. And thus the essence of every genuine—<em>unconscious and inwardly
necessary</em>—symbolism proceeds from the knowledge of death in which the
secret of space reveals itself. All symbolism implies a defensive; it is the
expression of a deep <span lang="de"><i>Scheu</i></span> in the old double sense of the word,<a id='r179'></a><a href='#f179' class='c019'><sup>[179]</sup></a> and its form-language
tells at once of hostility and of reverence.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Every thing-become is mortal.</em> Not only peoples, languages, races and Cultures
are transient. In a few centuries from now there will no more be a Western
Culture, no more be German, English or French than there were Romans in the
time of Justinian. Not that the sequence of human generations failed; it was
the inner form of a people, which had put together a number of these generations
as a single gesture, that was no longer there. The <span lang="la"><i>Civis Romanus</i></span>, one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>the most powerful symbols of Classical being, had nevertheless, as a form, only
a duration of some centuries. But the primitive phenomenon of the great
Culture will itself have disappeared some day, and with it the drama of world-history;
aye, and man himself, and beyond man the phenomenon of plant and
animal existence on the earth’s surface, the earth, the sun, the whole world
of sun-systems. All art is mortal, not merely the individual artifacts but the
arts themselves. One day the last portrait of Rembrandt and the last bar of
Mozart will have ceased to be—though possibly a coloured canvas and a sheet
of notes may remain—because the last eye and the last ear accessible to their
message will have gone. Every thought, faith and science dies as soon as the
spirits in whose worlds their “eternal truths” were true and necessary are
extinguished. Dead, even, are the star-worlds which “appeared,” a proper
world to the proper eye, to the astronomers of the Nile and the Euphrates, for
our eye is different from theirs; and our eye in its turn is mortal. All this we
know. The beast does not know, and what he does not know does not exist
in his experienced world-around. But if the image of the past vanishes, the
longing to give a deeper meaning to the passing vanishes also. And so it is
with reference to the purely human macrocosm that we apply the oft-quoted
line, which shall serve as motto for all that follows: <span lang="de"><i>Alles Vergängliche ist nur
ein Gleichnis</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>From this we are led, without our noticing it, back to the space-problem,
though now it takes on a fresh and surprising form. Indeed, it is as a corollary
to these ideas that it appears for the first time as capable of solution—or, to
speak more modestly, of enunciation—just as the time-problem was made
more comprehensible by way of the Destiny-idea. From the moment of our
awakening, the fateful and directed life appears in the phenomenal life as an
experienced <em>depth</em>. Everything extends itself, but it is not yet “space,” not
something established in itself but a self-extension continued from the moving
here to the moving there. World-experience is bound up with the essence of
<em>depth</em> (i.e., <em>far-ness</em> or <em>distance</em>). In the abstract system of mathematics, “depth”
is taken along with “length” and “breadth” as a “third” dimension; but
this trinity of elements of like order is misleading from the outset, for in our
impression of the spatial world these elements are unquestionably <em>not</em> equivalents,
let alone homogeneous. Length and breadth are no doubt, experientially,
a unit and not a mere sum, but they are (the phrase is used deliberately)
simply a form of reception; they represent the purely sensuous impression.
But depth is a representation of <em>expression</em>, of <em>Nature</em>, and with it begins the
“world.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This discrimination between the “third” and the other two dimensions,
so called, which needless to say is wholly alien to mathematics, is inherent
also in the opposition of the notions of sensation and contemplation. Extension
into depth converts the former into the latter; in fact, depth is the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>and genuine dimension in the literal sense of the word.<a id='r180'></a><a href='#f180' class='c019'><sup>[180]</sup></a> In it the waking consciousness
is active, whereas in the others it is strictly passive. It is the <em>symbolic
content of a particular order</em> as understood by one particular Culture that is expressed
by this original fundamental and unanalysable element. The experiencing
of depth (this is a premiss upon which all that follows is dependent) is an
act, as entirely involuntary and necessary as it is creative, whereby the ego
keeps its world, so to say, in subordination (zudiktiert erhält). Out of the
rain of impressions the ego fashions a formal unit, a cinematic <em>picture</em>, which as
soon as it is mastered by the understanding is subjected to law and the causality
principle; and therefore, as the projection of an individual spirit it is transient
and mortal.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is no doubt, however reason may contest it, that this extension is
capable of infinite variety, and that it operates differently not merely as between
child and man, or nature-man and townsman, or Chinese and Romans, but as
between individual and individual according as they experience their worlds
contemplatively or alertly, actively or placidly. Every artist has rendered
“Nature” by line and by tone, every physicist—Greek, Arabian or German—has
dissected “Nature” into ultimate elements, and how is it that they have
not all discovered the same? Because every one of them has had his own
Nature, though—with a naïveté that was really the salvation of his world-idea
and of his own self—every one believed that he had it in common with all
the rest. Nature is a possession which is saturated through and through with
the most personal connotations. <em>Nature is a function of the particular Culture.</em></p>

<h4 class='c021'>III</h4>

<p class='c018'>Kant believed that he had decided the great question of whether this <span lang="la"><i>a
priori</i></span> element was pre-existent or obtained by experience, by his celebrated
formula that Space is the form of perception which underlies all world impressions.
But the “world” of the careless child and the dreamer undeniably
possess this form in an insecure and hesitant way,<a id='r181'></a><a href='#f181' class='c019'><sup>[181]</sup></a> and it is only the tense,
practical, <em>technical</em> treatment of the world-around—imposed on the free-moving
being which, unlike the lilies of the fields, must care for its life—that lets
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>sensuous self-extension stiffen into rational tridimensionality. And it is only
the city-man of matured Cultures that really <em>lives</em> in this glaring wakefulness,
and only for his thought that there is a Space wholly divorced from sensuous
life, “absolute,” dead and alien to Time; and it exists not as a form of the
intuitively-perceived but as a form of the rationally-comprehended. There is
no manner of doubt that the “space” which Kant saw all around him with
such unconditional certainty when he was thinking out his theory, did not
exist in anything like so rigorous a form for his Carolingian ancestors. Kant’s
greatness consists in his having created the idea of a "form <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span>," but not in
the application that he gave it. We have already seen that Time is not a “form
of perception” nor for that matter a form at all—forms exist only in the
extended—and that there is no possibility of defining it except as a counter-concept
to Space. But there is the further question—does this word “space”
exactly cover the formal content of the intuitively-perceived? And beyond all
this there is the plain fact that the “form of perception” <em>alters with distance</em>.
Every distant mountain range is “perceived” as a scenic plane. No one will
pretend that he sees the moon as a body; for the eye it is a pure plane and it is
only by the aid of the telescope—i.e. when the distance is artificially reduced—that
it progressively obtains a spatial form. Obviously, then, the “form
of perception” is a function of distance. Moreover, when we reflect upon
anything, we do not exactly remember the impressions that we received at
the time, but “represent to ourselves” the picture of a space abstracted from
them. But this representation may and does deceive us regarding the living
actuality. Kant let himself be misled; he should certainly not have permitted
himself to distinguish between forms of perception and forms of ratiocination,
for <em>his</em> notion of Space in principle embraced both.<a id='r182'></a><a href='#f182' class='c019'><sup>[182]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Just as Kant marred the Time-problem by bringing it into relation with an
essentially misunderstood arithmetic and—on that basis—dealing with a
phantom sort of time that lacks the life-quality of direction and is therefore
a mere spatial scheme, so also he marred the Space-problem by relating it to
a common-place geometry.</p>

<p class='c001'>It befell that a few years after the completion of Kant’s main work Gauss
discovered the first of the Non-Euclidean geometries. These, irreproachably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>demonstrated as regards their own internal validity, enable it to be proved that
there are <em>several</em> strictly mathematical kinds of three-dimensional extension, all
of which are <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> certain, and none of which can be singled out to rank as
the genuine “form of perception.”</p>

<p class='c001'>It was a grave, and in a contemporary of Euler and Lagrange an unpardonable,
error to postulate that the Classical school-geometry (for it was that
which Kant always had in mind) was to be found reproduced in the forms of
Nature around us. In moments of attentive observation at very short range,
and in cases in which the relations considered are sufficiently small, the living
impressions and the rules of customary geometry are certainly in approximate
agreement. But the <em>exact</em> conformity asserted by philosophy can be demonstrated
neither by the eye nor by measuring-instruments. Both these must
always stop short at a certain limit of accuracy which is very far indeed below
that which would be necessary, say, for determining which of the Non-Euclidean
geometries is the geometry of “empirical” Space.<a id='r183'></a><a href='#f183' class='c019'><sup>[183]</sup></a> On the large
scales and for great distances, where the experience of depth completely dominates
the perception-picture (for example, looking on a broad landscape as
against a drawing) the form of perception is in fundamental contradiction with
mathematics. A glance down any avenue shows us that parallels meet at the
horizon. Western perspective and the otherwise quite different perspective
of Chinese painting are both alike based on this fact, and the connexion of
these perspectives with the root-problems of their respective mathematics is
unmistakable.</p>

<p class='c001'>Experiential Depth, in the infinite variety of its modes, eludes every sort
of numerical definition. The whole of lyric poetry and music, the entire painting
of Egypt, China and the West by hypothesis deny any strictly mathematical
structure in space as felt and seen, and it is only because all modern philosophers
have been destitute of the smallest understanding of painting that they have
failed to note the contradiction. The “horizon” <em>in and by which every visual
image gradually passes into a definitive plane</em>, is incapable of any mathematical
treatment. Every stroke of a landscape painter’s brush refutes the assertions
of conventional epistemology.</p>

<p class='c001'>As mathematical magnitudes abstract from life, the “three dimensions”
have no natural limits. But when this proposition becomes entangled with the
surface-and-depth of experienced impression, the original epistemological error
leads to another, viz., that apprehended extension is also without limits,
although in fact our vision only comprises the <em>illuminated</em> portion of space
and stops at the light-limit of the particular moment, which may be the star-heavens
or merely the bright atmosphere. The “visual” world is the totality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>of <em>light-resistances</em>, since vision depends on the presence of radiated or reflected
light. The Greeks took their stand on this and stayed there. It is the Western
world-feeling that has produced the idea of a limitless universe of space—a
space of infinite star-systems and distances that far transcends all optical possibilities—and
this was a creation of the <em>inner</em> vision, incapable of all actualization
through the eye, and, even as an idea, alien to and unachievable by the
men of a differently-disposed Culture.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>IV</h4>

<p class='c018'>The outcome, then, of Gauss’s discovery, which <em>completely</em> altered the course
of modern mathematics,<a id='r184'></a><a href='#f184' class='c019'><sup>[184]</sup></a> was the statement that there are severally equally
valid structures of three-dimensional extension. That it should even be asked
which of them corresponds to actual perception shows that the problem was
not in the least comprehended. Mathematics, whether or not it employs visible
images and representations as working conveniences, concerns itself with systems
that are entirely emancipated from life, time and distance, with form-worlds
of pure numbers whose validity—not <em>fact-foundation</em>—is timeless
and like everything else that is “known” is known by causal logic and not
experienced.</p>

<p class='c001'>With this, the difference between the living intuition-way and the mathematical
form-language became manifest and the secret of <em>spatial becoming</em> opened
out.</p>

<p class='c001'>As becoming is the foundation of the become, continuous living history
that of fulfilled dead nature, the organic that of the mechanical, destiny that
of causal law and the causally-settled, so too <em>direction is the origin of extension.
The secret of Life accomplishing itself which is touched upon by the word Time forms the
foundation of that which, as accomplished, is understood by</em> (or rather <em>indicated to an
inner feeling in us by</em>) <em>the word Space</em>. Every extension that is actual has first been
accomplished in and with an experience of depth, and what is primarily indicated
by the word Time is just this process of extending, first sensuously (in the
main, visually) and only later intellectually, into depth and distance, i.e., the
<em>step</em> from the planar semi-impression to the macrocosmically ordered world-picture
with its mysterious-manifest kinesis. We feel—and the feeling is what
constitutes the state of all-round awareness in us—that we are <em>in</em> an extension
that encircles us; and it is only necessary to follow out this original impression
that we have of the worldly to see that in reality there is only one true “dimension”
of space, which is direction from one’s self outwards into the distance, the
“there” and the future, and that the abstract system of three dimensions is a
mechanical representation and not a fact of life. By the depth-experience sensation
is <em>expanded</em> into the world. We have seen already that the directedness that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>is in life wears the badge of <em>irreversibility</em>, and there is something of this same
hall-mark of Time in our instinctive tendency to feel the depth that is in the
world uni-directionally also—viz., from ourselves outwards, and never from
the horizon inwards. The bodily mobility of man and beast is disposed in
this sense. We move <em>forward</em>—towards the Future, nearing with every step
not merely our aim but our old age—and we feel every <em>backward</em> look as a
glance at something that is past, that has already become history.<a id='r185'></a><a href='#f185' class='c019'><sup>[185]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>If we can describe the basic form of the understood, viz., causality, as <em>destiny
become rigid</em>, we may similarly speak of spatial depth as a <em>time become rigid</em>. That
which not only man but even the beast <em>feels</em> operative around him as destiny,
he <em>perceives</em> by touching, looking, listening, scenting as movement, and under
his intense scrutiny it stiffens and becomes causal. We <em>feel</em> that it is drawing
towards spring and we feel in advance how the spring landscape expands around
us; but we <em>know</em> that the earth as it moves in space revolves and that the duration
of spring consists of ninety such revolutions of the earth, or days. Time gives
birth to Space, but Space gives death to Time.</p>

<p class='c001'>Had Kant been more precise, he would, instead of speaking of the “two
forms of perception,” have called time the form of perception and space the
form of the perceived, and then the connexion of the two would probably have
revealed itself to him. The logician, mathematician, or scientist in his moments
of intense thought, knows only the Become—which has been detached from
the singular event by the very act of meditating upon it—and true systematic
space—in which everything possesses the <em>property</em> of a mathematically-expressible
“duration.” But it is just this that indicates to us how space is
continuously “becoming.” While we gaze into the distance with our senses,
it floats around us, but when we are startled, the alert eye sees a tense and rigid
space. This space <em>is</em>; the principle of its existing at all is that it is, outside time
and detached from it and from life. In it duration, a piece of perished time,
resides as a known property of things. And, as we know ourselves too as
<em>being</em> in this space, we know that we also have a duration and a limit, of which
the moving finger of our clock ceaselessly warns us. But the rigid Space itself
is transient too—at the first relaxation of our intellectual tension it vanishes
from the many-coloured spread of our world-around—and so it is a sign and
symbol of <em>the most elemental and powerful symbol</em>, of life itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>For the involuntary and unqualified realization of depth, which dominates
the consciousness with the force of an elemental event (<em>simultaneously with the
awakening of the inner life</em>), marks the frontier between child and ... Man. The
symbolic experience of depth is what is lacking in the child, who grasps at the
moon and knows as yet no meaning in the outer world but, like the soul of
primitive man, dawns in a dreamlike continuum of sensations (in traumhafter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>Verbundenheit mit allem Empfindungshaften hindämmert). Of course the child
is not without experience of the extended, of a very simple kind, but there is
no <em>world-perception</em>; distance is felt, but it does not yet speak to the soul. And
with the soul’s awakening, direction, too, first reaches living expression—Classical
expression in steady adherence to the near-present and exclusion of
the distant and future; Faustian in direction-energy which has an eye only for
the most distant horizons; Chinese, in free hither-and-thither wandering that
nevertheless goes to the goal; Egyptian in resolute march down the path once
entered. Thus the Destiny-idea manifests itself in every line of a life. With it
alone do we become members of a particular Culture, whose members are connected
by a common world-feeling and a common world-form derived from it.
A deep identity unites the awakening of the <em>soul</em>, its birth into clear existence
in the name of a Culture, with the sudden realization of distance and time, the
<em>birth of its outer world</em> through the symbol of extension; and thenceforth this
symbol is and remains the <em>prime symbol</em> of that life, imparting to it its specific
style and the historical form in which it progressively actualizes its inward
possibilities. From the specific directedness is derived the specific prime-symbol
of extension, namely, for the Classical world-view the near, strictly
limited, self-contained Body, for the Western infinitely wide and infinitely
profound three-dimensional Space, for the Arabian the world as a Cavern. And
therewith an old philosophical problem dissolves into nothing: this prime form
of the world is <em>innate</em> in so far as it is an original possession of the soul of that
Culture which is expressed by our life as a whole, and <em>acquired</em> in so far that
every individual soul re-enacts for itself that creative act and unfolds in early
childhood the symbol of depth to which its existence is predestined, as the
emerging butterfly unfolds its wings. The first comprehension of depth is <em>an
act of birth</em>—the spiritual complement of the bodily.<a id='r186'></a><a href='#f186' class='c019'><sup>[186]</sup></a> In it the Culture is born
out of its mother-landscape, and the act is repeated by every one of its individual
souls throughout its life-course. This is what Plato—connecting it with an
early Hellenic belief—called anamnesis. The definiteness of the world-form,
which for each dawning soul <em>suddenly is</em>, derives meaning from Becoming.
Kant the systematic, however, with his conception of the form <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span>, would
approach the interpretation of this very riddle from a dead result instead of
along a living way.</p>

<p class='c001'>From now on, we shall consider the <cite>kind of extension as the prime symbol of a
Culture</cite>. From it we are to deduce the entire form-language of its actuality, its
physiognomy as contrasted with the physiognomy of every other Culture and
still more with the almost entire lack of physiognomy in primitive man’s
world-around. For now the interpretation of depth rises to acts, to formative
expression in works, to the <cite>trans</cite>-forming of actuality, not now merely in order
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>to subserve necessities of life (as in the case of the animals) but above all to
create a picture out of extensional elements of all sorts (material, line, colour,
tone, motion)—a picture, often, that re-emerges with power to charm after
lost centuries in the world-picture of another Culture and tells new men of the
way in which its authors understood the world.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the prime symbol does not actualize itself; it is operative through the
form-sense of every man, every community, age and epoch and dictates the
style of every life-expression. It is inherent in the form of the state, the religious
myths and cults, the ethical ideals, the forms of painting and music and poetry,
the fundamental notions of each science—but it is not presented by these.
Consequently, it is not presentable by words, for language and words are themselves
<cite>derived</cite> symbols. Every individual symbol tells of it, but only to the inner
feelings, not to the understanding. And when we say, as henceforth we shall
say, that the prime-symbol of the Classical soul is the material and individual
body, that of the Western pure infinite space, it must always be with the
reservation that concepts cannot represent the inconceivable, and thus at the
most a <cite>significative feeling</cite> may be evoked by the sound of words.</p>

<p class='c001'>Infinite space is the ideal that the Western soul has always striven to find,
and to see immediately actualized, in its world-around; and hence it is that the
countless space-theories of the last centuries possess—over and above all ostensible
“results”—a deep import as symptoms of a world-feeling. In how far
does unlimited extension <cite>underlie</cite> all objective things? There is hardly a single
problem that has been more earnestly pondered than this; it would almost seem
as if every other world-question was dependent upon the one problem of the
nature of space. And is it not in fact so—<cite>for us</cite>? And how, then, has it
escaped notice that the whole Classical world never expended one word on it,
and indeed did not even possess a word<a id='r187'></a><a href='#f187' class='c019'><sup>[187]</sup></a> by which the problem could be exactly
outlined? Why had the great pre-Socratics nothing to say on it? Did they
overlook in their world just that which appears to us the problem of all problems?
Ought we not, in fact, to have seen long ago that the answer is in the
very fact of their silence? How is it that according to <cite>our</cite> deepest feeling the
“world” is nothing but that world-of-space which is the true offspring of our
depth-experience, and whose grand emptiness is corroborated by the star-systems
lost in it? Could a “world” of this sense have been made even comprehensible
to a Classical thinker? In short, we suddenly discover that the
“eternal problem” that Kant, in the name of humanity, tackled with a passion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>that itself is symbolic, is a <cite>purely Western</cite> problem that simply does not arise
in the intellects of other Cultures.</p>

<p class='c001'>What then was it that Classical man, whose insight into his own world-around
was certainly not less piercing than ours, regarded as the prime problem
of all being? It was the problem of ἀρχή, the <em>material origin and foundation</em> of
all sensuously-perceptible things. If we grasp this we shall get close to the
significance of the fact—not the fact of space, but the fact that made it a
necessity of destiny for the space-problem to become the problem of the Western,
and only the Western, soul.<a id='r188'></a><a href='#f188' class='c019'><sup>[188]</sup></a> This very spatiality (Räumlichkeit) that is
the truest and sublimest element in the aspect of <em>our</em> universe, that absorbs into
itself and begets out of itself the substantiality of all things, Classical humanity
(which knows no word for, and therefore has no idea of, space) with one accord
cuts out as the nonent, τὸ μὴ ὄν, that which <em>is not</em>. The pathos of this denial
can scarcely be exaggerated. The whole passion of the Classical soul is in this
act of excluding by symbolic negation that which it <em>would</em> not feel as actual,
that in which its own existence <em>could</em> not be expressed. A world of other colour
suddenly confronts us here. The Classical statue in its splendid bodiliness—all
structure and expressive surfaces and no incorporeal <span lang="fr"><i>arrière-pensée</i></span> whatsoever—contains
without remainder all that Actuality is for the Classical eye. The
material, the optically definite, the comprehensible, the immediately present—this
list exhausts the characteristics of this kind of extension. The Classical
universe, the <em>Cosmos</em> or well-ordered aggregate of all near and completely viewable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>things, is concluded by the corporeal vault of heaven. More there is
not. The need that is in us to think of “space” as being behind as well as
before this shell was wholly absent from the Classical world-feeling. The
Stoics went so far as to treat even properties and relations of things as “bodies.”
For Chrysippus, the Divine Pneuma is a “body,” for Democritus seeing consists
in our being penetrated by material particles of the things seen. The
State is a body which is made up of all the bodies of its citizens, the law knows
only corporeal persons and material things. And the feeling finds its last and
noblest expression in the stone body of the Classical temple. The windowless
interior is carefully concealed by the array of columns; but outside there is not
one truly straight line to be found. Every flight of steps has a slight sweep
outward, every step relatively to the next. The pediment, the roof-ridge, the
sides are all curved. Every column has a slight swell and none stand truly
vertical or truly equidistant from one another. But swell and inclination and
distance vary from the corners to the centres of the sides in a carefully toned-off
ratio, and so the whole corpus is given a something that swings mysterious
about a centre. The curvatures are so fine that to a certain extent they are
invisible to the eye and only to be “sensed.” But it is just by these means that
direction in depth is eliminated. While the Gothic style <em>soars</em>, the Ionic <em>swings</em>.
The interior of the cathedral pulls up with primeval force, but the temple is
laid down in majestic rest. All this is equally true as relating to the Faustian
and Apollinian Deity, and likewise of the fundamental ideas of the respective
physics. To the principles of position, material and form we have opposed
those of straining movement, force and mass, and we have defined the last-named
as a constant ratio between force and acceleration, nay, finally volatilized
both in the purely spatial elements of <em>capacity</em> and <em>intensity</em>. It was an obligatory
consequence also of this way of conceiving actuality that the instrumental
music of the great 18th-Century masters should emerge as a master-art—for it
is the only one of the arts whose form-world is inwardly related to the contemplative
vision of pure space. In it, as opposed to the statues of Classical
temple and forum, we have bodiless realms of tone, tone-intervals, tone-seas.
The orchestra swells, breaks, and ebbs, it depicts distances, lights, shadows,
storms, driving clouds, lightning flashes, colours etherealized and transcendent—think
of the instrumentation of Gluck and Beethoven. “Contemporary,”
in our sense, with the Canon of Polycletus, the treatise in which the great
sculptor laid down the strict rules of human body-build which remained
authoritative till beyond Lysippus, we find the strict canon (completed by
Stamitz about 1740) of the sonata-movement of four elements which begins
to relax in late-Beethoven quartets and symphonies and, finally, in the lonely,
utterly infinitesimal tone-world of the “Tristan” music, frees itself from all
earthly comprehensibleness. This prime feeling of a loosing, Erlösung, solution,
of the Soul in the Infinite, of a liberation from all material heaviness which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>highest moments of our music always awaken, sets free also the energy of depth
that is in the Faustian soul: whereas the effect of the Classical art-work is to
bind and to bound, and the body-feeling secures, brings back the eye from
distance to a Near and Still that is saturated with beauty.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>V</h3>

<p class='c018'>Each of the great Cultures, then, has arrived at a secret language of world-feeling
that is only fully comprehensible by him whose soul belongs to that
Culture. We must not deceive ourselves. Perhaps we can read a little way
into the Classical soul, because its form-language is almost the exact inversion
of the Western; how far we have succeeded or can ever succeed is a question
which necessarily forms the starting-point of all criticism of the Renaissance,
and it is a very difficult one. But when we are told that probably (it is at best a
doubtful venture to meditate upon so alien an expression of Being) the Indians
conceived numbers which according to our ideas possessed neither value nor
magnitude nor relativity, and which only became positive and negative, great
or small units in virtue of position, we have to admit that it is impossible for
us exactly to re-experience what spiritually underlies this kind of number. For
us, 3 is always <em>something</em>, be it positive or negative; for the Greeks it was unconditionally
a positive magnitude, +3; but for the Indian it indicates a possibility
without existence, to which the word “something” is <em>not yet</em> applicable,
outside both existence and non-existence which are <em>properties</em> to be introduced
into it. +3, -3, ⅓, are thus emanating actualities of subordinate rank which
reside in the mysterious substance (3) in some way that is entirely hidden from
us. It takes a Brahmanic soul to perceive these numbers as self-evident, as ideal
emblems of a self-complete world-form; to us they are as unintelligible as is the
Brahman Nirvana, for which, as lying beyond life <em>and</em> death, sleep <em>and</em> waking,
passion, compassion <em>and</em> dispassion and yet somehow actual, words entirely
fail us. Only this spirituality could originate the grand conception of <em>nothingness
as a true number, zero</em>, and even then this zero is the Indian zero for which
existent and non-existent are equally external designations.<a id='r189'></a><a href='#f189' class='c019'><sup>[189]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Arabian thinkers of the ripest period—and they included minds of the very
first order like Alfarabi and Alkabi—in controverting the ontology of Aristotle,
<em>proved</em> that the body as such did not necessarily assume space for existence,
and deduced the essence of this space—the <em>Arabian</em> kind of extension, that is—from
the characteristic of “one’s being in a position.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>But this does not prove that as against Aristotle and Kant they were in error
or that their thinking was muddled (as we so readily say of what our own
brains cannot take in). It shows that the Arabian spirit possessed other world-categories
than our own. They could have rebutted Kant, or Kant them, with
the same subtlety of proof—and both disputants would have remained convinced
of the correctness of their respective standpoints.</p>

<p class='c001'>When we talk of space to-day, we are all thinking more or less in the same
style, just as we are all using the same languages and word-signs, whether we
are considering mathematical space or physical space or the space of painting
or that of actuality, although all philosophizing that insists (as it must) upon
putting an <em>identity</em> of understanding in the place of such kinship of significance-feeling
must remain somewhat questionable. But no Hellene or Egyptian or
Chinaman could re-experience any part of those feelings of ours, and no artwork
or thought-system could possibly convey to him unequivocally what
“space” means for us. Again, the prime conceptions originated in the quite
differently constituted soul of the Greek, like ἀρχή, ὕλη, μορφἠ, comprise the
whole content of his world. But this world is differently constituted from ours.
It is, for us, alien and remote. We may take these words of Greek and translate
them by words of our own like “origin,” “matter” and “form,” but it is mere
imitation, a feeble effort to penetrate into a world of feeling in which the finest
and deepest elements, in spite of all we can do, remain dumb; it is as though
one tried to set the Parthenon sculptures for a string quartet, or cast Voltaire’s
God in bronze. The master-traits of thought, life and world-consciousness are
as manifold and different as the features of individual men; in those respects
as in others there are distinctions of “races” and “peoples,” and men are as
unconscious of these distinctions as they are ignorant of whether “red” and
“yellow” do or do not mean the same for others as for themselves. It is particularly
the common symbolic of language that nourishes the illusion of a
homogeneous constitution of human inner-life and an identical world-form;
in this respect the great thinkers of one and another Culture resemble the
colour-blind in that each is unaware of his own condition and smiles at the
errors of the rest.</p>

<p class='c001'>And now I draw the conclusions. There is a plurality of prime symbols.
It is the depth-experience through which the world becomes, through which
perception <em>extends itself</em> to world. Its signification is for the soul to which it
belongs and only for that soul, and it is different in waking and dreaming,
acceptance and scrutiny, as between young and old, townsmen and peasant,
man and woman. It actualizes for every high Culture the possibility of form
upon which that Culture’s existence rests and it does so of deep necessity. All
fundamentals words like our mass, substance, material, thing, body, extension
(and multitudes of words of the like order in other culture-tongues) are emblems,
obligatory and determined by destiny, that out of the infinite abundance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>of world-possibilities evoke in the name of the individual Culture those possibilities
that alone are significant and therefore necessary for it. None of them
is exactly transferable just as it is into the experiential living and knowing of
another Culture. And none of these prime words ever recurs. The <em>choice of prime
symbol</em> in the moment of the Culture-soul’s awakening into self-consciousness
on its own soil—a moment that for one who can read world-history thus
contains something catastrophic—decides all.</p>

<p class='c029'>Culture, as the soul’s total expression “become” and perceptible in gestures
and works, as its mortal transient body, obnoxious to law, number
and causality:</p>

<p class='c030'>As the historical drama, a picture in the whole picture of world-history:</p>

<p class='c030'>As the sum of grand emblems of life, feeling and understanding:</p>

<p class='c009'>—this is the language through which alone a soul can tell of what it undergoes.</p>

<p class='c001'>The macrocosm, too, is a property of the individual soul; we can never know
how it stands with the soul of another. That which is implied by “infinite
space,” the space that “passeth all understanding,” which is the creative
interpretation of depth-experience proper and peculiar to us men of the West—the
kind of extension that is nothingness to the Greeks, the Universe to us—dyes
our world in a colour that the Classical, the Indian and the Egyptian souls
had not on their palettes. One soul listens to the world-experience in A flat
major, another in F minor; one apprehends it in the Euclidean spirit, another
in the contrapuntal, a third in the Magian spirit. From the purest analytical
Space and from Nirvana to the most somatic reality of Athens, there is a series
of prime symbols each of which is capable of forming a complete world out of
itself. And, as the idea of the Babylonian or that of the Indian world was
remote, strange and elusive for the men of the five or six Cultures that followed,
so also the Western world will be incomprehensible to the men of Cultures
yet unborn.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c016'>II <br> APOLLINIAN, FAUSTIAN AND MAGIAN SOUL</h3>

<h4 class='c026'>I</h4>

<p class='c018'>Henceforth we shall designate the soul of the Classical Culture, which chose
the sensuously-present individual body as the ideal type of the extended, by the
name (familiarized by Nietzsche) of the <em>Apollinian</em>. In opposition to it we have
the <em>Faustian</em> soul, whose prime-symbol is pure and limitless space, and whose
“body” is the Western Culture that blossomed forth with the birth of the
Romanesque style in the 10th century in the Northern plain between the Elbe
and the Tagus. The nude statue is Apollinian, the art of the fugue Faustian.
Apollinian are: mechanical statics, the sensuous cult of the Olympian gods,
the politically individual city-states of Greece, the doom of Œdipus and the
phallus-symbol. Faustian are: Galileian dynamics, Catholic and Protestant
dogmatics, the great dynasties of the Baroque with their cabinet diplomacy,
the destiny of Lear and the Madonna-ideal from Dante’s Beatrice to the last
line of <em>Faust II</em>. The painting that defines the individual body by contours
is Apollinian, that which forms space by means of light and shade is Faustian—this
is the difference between the fresco of Polygnotus and the oil painting of
Rembrandt. The Apollinian existence is that of the Greek who describes his
ego as <em>soma</em> and who lacks all idea of an inner development and therefore all
real history, inward and outward; the Faustian is an existence which <em>is led</em>
with a deep consciousness and introspection of the ego, and a resolutely personal
culture evidenced in memoirs, reflections, retrospects and prospects and
conscience. And in the time of Augustus, in the countries between Nile
and Tigris, Black Sea and South Arabia, there appears—aloof but able to
speak to us through forms borrowed, adopted and inherited—the Magian
soul of the Arabian Culture with its algebra, astrology and alchemy, its
mosaics and arabesques, its caliphates and mosques, and the sacraments and
scriptures of the Persian, Jewish, Christian, “post-Classical” and Manichæan
religions.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Space”—speaking now in the Faustian idiom—is a spiritual something,
rigidly distinct from the momentary sense-present, which <em>could</em> not be represented
in an Apollinian language, whether Greek or Latin. But the created
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span><em>expression-space</em> of the Apollinian arts is equally alien to ours. The tiny cella
of the early-Classical temple was a dumb dark nothingness, a structure (originally)
of perishable material, an envelope of the moment in contrast to the
eternal vaults of Magian cupolas and Gothic naves, and the closed ranks of
columns were expressly meant to convey that for the eye at any rate this body
possessed no <em>Inward</em>. In no other Culture is the firm footing, the socket, so
emphasized. The Doric column bores into the ground, the vessels are always
thought of from below upward (whereas those of the Renaissance float above
their footing), and the sculpture-schools feel the stabilizing of their figures as
their main problem. Hence in archaic works the legs are disproportionately
emphasized, the foot is planted on the full sole, and if the drapery falls straight
down, a part of the hem is removed to show that the foot is standing. The
Classical relief is strictly stereometrically set on a plane, and there is an interspace
between the figures but no depth. A landscape of Claude Lorrain, on
the contrary, is <em>nothing but</em> space, every detail being made to subserve its illustration.
All bodies in it possess an atmospheric and perspective meaning purely
as carriers of light and shade. The extreme of this disembodiment of the world
in the service of space is Impressionism. Given this world-feeling, the Faustian
soul in the springtime necessarily arrived at an architectural problem which
had its centre of gravity in the spatial vaulting-over of vast, and from porch
to choir dynamically deep, cathedrals. This last expressed <em>its</em> depth-experience.
But with it was associated, in opposition to the cavernous Magian expression-space,<a id='r190'></a><a href='#f190' class='c019'><sup>[190]</sup></a>
the element of a soaring into the broad universe. Magian roofing,
whether it be cupola or barrel-vault or even the horizontal baulk of a basilica,
<em>covers in</em>. Strzygowski<a id='r191'></a><a href='#f191' class='c019'><sup>[191]</sup></a> has very aptly described the architectural idea of
Hagia Sophia as an introverted Gothic striving under a closed outer casing. On
the other hand, in the cathedral of Florence the cupola <em>crowns</em> the long Gothic
body of 1367, and the same tendency rose in Bramante’s scheme for St. Peter’s
to a veritable towering-up, a magnificent “Excelsior,” that Michelangelo
carried to completion with the dome that floats high and bright over the vast
vaulting. To this sense of space the Classical opposes the symbol of the Doric
peripteros, wholly corporeal and comprehensible in one glance.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Classical Culture begins, then, with a great <em>renunciation</em>. A rich, pictorial,
almost over-ripe art lay ready to its hand. But this <em>could</em> not become the
expression of the young soul, and so from about 1100 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> the harsh, narrow, and
to our eyes scanty and barbaric, early-Doric geometrical style appears in opposition
to the Minoan.<a id='r192'></a><a href='#f192' class='c019'><sup>[192]</sup></a> For the three centuries which correspond to the flowering
of our Gothic, there is no hint of an architecture, and it is only at about
650 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, “contemporarily” with Michelangelo’s transition into the Baroque,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>that the Doric and Etruscan temple-type arises. All “Early” art is religious,
and this symbolic Negation is not less so than the Egyptian and the Gothic
Affirmation. The idea of <em>burning</em> the dead accords with the cult-site but not
with the cult-building; and the Early Classical religion which conceals itself
from us behind the solemn names of Calchas, Tiresias, Orpheus and (probably)
Numa<a id='r193'></a><a href='#f193' class='c019'><sup>[193]</sup></a> possessed for its rites simply that which is left of an architectural idea
when one has subtracted the architecture, viz., the sacred precinct. The original
cult-plan is thus the Etruscan templum, a sacred area merely staked off on the
ground by the augurs with an impassable boundary and a propitious entrance
on the East side.<a id='r194'></a><a href='#f194' class='c019'><sup>[194]</sup></a> A “templum” was created where a rite was to be performed
or where the representative of the state authority, senate or army, happened to
be. It existed only for the duration of its use, and the spell was then removed.
It was probably only about 700 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> that the Classical soul so far mastered itself
as to represent this architectural Nothing in the sensible form of a built body.
In the long run the Euclidean feeling proved stronger than the mere antipathy
to duration.</p>

<p class='c001'>Faustian architecture, on the contrary, begins on the grand scale simultaneously
with the first stirrings of a new piety (the Cluniac reform, c. 1000) and a
new thought (the Eucharistic controversy between Berengar of Tours and
Lanfranc 1050),<a id='r195'></a><a href='#f195' class='c019'><sup>[195]</sup></a> and proceeds at once to plans of gigantic intention; often
enough, as in the case of Speyer, the whole community did not suffice to fill
the cathedral,<a id='r196'></a><a href='#f196' class='c019'><sup>[196]</sup></a> and often again it proved impossible to complete the projected
scheme. The passionate language of this architecture is that of the poems
too.<a id='r197'></a><a href='#f197' class='c019'><sup>[197]</sup></a> Far apart as may seem the Christian hymnology of the south and the
Eddas of the still heathen north, they are alike in the implicit space-endlessness
of prosody, rhythmic syntax and imagery. Read the <span lang="la"><i>Dies Iræ</i></span> together with
the Völuspá,<a id='r198'></a><a href='#f198' class='c019'><sup>[198]</sup></a> which is little earlier; there is the same adamantine will to overcome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>and break all resistances of the visible. No rhythm ever imagined radiates
immensities of space and distance as the old Northern does:</p>

<p class='c018'>The accents of the Homeric hexameter are the soft rustle of a leaf in the
midday sun, the rhythm of <em>matter</em>; but the <span lang="de">“Stabreim”</span> likes “potential energy”
in the world-pictures of modern physics, creates a tense restraint in the void
without limits, distant night-storms above the highest peaks. In its swaying
indefiniteness all words and things dissolve themselves—it is the dynamics,
not the statics, of language. The same applies to the grave rhythm of <span lang="la"><i>Media
vita in morte sumus</i></span>. Here is heralded the colour of Rembrandt and the instrumentation
of Beethoven—<em>here infinite solitude is felt as the home of the Faustian
soul</em>. What is Valhalla? Unknown to the Germans of the Migrations and even
to the Merovingian Age, it was conceived by the nascent Faustian soul. It was
conceived, no doubt, under Classic-pagan and Arabian-Christian impressions,
for the antique and the sacred writings, the ruins and mosaics and miniatures,
the cults and rites and dogmas of these past Cultures reached into the new life
at all points. <em>And yet</em>, this Valhalla is something beyond all sensible actualities
floating in remote, dim, Faustian regions. Olympus rests on the homely Greek
soil, the Paradise of the Fathers is a magic garden somewhere in the Universe,
but Valhalla is nowhere. Lost in the limitless, it appears with its inharmonious
gods and heroes the supreme symbol of solitude. Siegfried, Parzeval, Tristan,
Hamlet, Faust are the loneliest heroes in all the Cultures. Read the wondrous
awakening of the inner life in Wolfram’s Parzeval. The longing for the woods,
the mysterious compassion, the ineffable sense of forsakenness—it is all
Faustian and only Faustian. Every one of us knows it. The motive returns
with all its profundity in the Easter scene of Faust I.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c025'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A longing pure and not to be described</div>
      <div class='line'>drove me to wander over woods and fields,</div>

      <div class='line'>I felt a world arise and live for me.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Of this world-experience neither Apollinian nor Magian man, neither Homer
nor the Gospels, knows anything whatever. The climax of the poem of Wolfram,
that wondrous Good Friday morning scene when the hero, at odds with
God and with himself, meets the noble Gawan and resolves to go on pilgrimage
to Tevrezent, takes us to the heart of the <em>Faustian</em> religion. Here one can feel
the mystery of the Eucharist which binds the communicant to a mystic company,
to a Church that alone can give bliss. In the myth of the Holy Grail
and its Knights one can feel the inward necessity of the German-Northern
Catholicism. In opposition to the Classical sacrifices offered to individual gods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>in separate temples, there is here the <em>one never-ending</em> sacrifice repeated everywhere
and every day. This is the Faustian idea of the 9th-11th Centuries, the Edda
time, foreshadowed by Anglo-Saxon missionaries like Winfried but only then
ripened. The Cathedral, with its High Altar enclosing the accomplished
miracle, is its expression in stone.<a id='r199'></a><a href='#f199' class='c019'><sup>[199]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The plurality of separate bodies which represents Cosmos for the Classical
soul, requires a similar pantheon—hence the antique polytheism. The <em>single</em>
world-volume, be it conceived as cavern or as space, demands the <em>single</em> god of
Magian or Western Christianity. Athene or Apollo might be represented by a
statue, but it is and has long been evident to our feeling that the Deity of the
Reformation and the Counter-Reformation can only be “manifested” in the
storm of an organ fugue or the solemn progress of cantata and mass. From the
rich manifold of figures in the Edda and contemporary legends of saints to
Goethe our myth develops itself in steady opposition to the Classical—in
the one case a continuous disintegration of the divine that culminated in the
early Empire in an impossible multitude of deities, in the other a process of
simplification that led to the Deism of the 18th Century.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Magian hierarchy of heaven—angels, saints, persons of the Trinity—has
grown paler and paler, more and more disembodied, in the sphere of the
Western pseudomorphosis,<a id='r200'></a><a href='#f200' class='c019'><sup>[200]</sup></a> supported though it was by the whole weight of
Church authority, and even the Devil—the great adversary in the Gothic
world-drama<a id='r201'></a><a href='#f201' class='c019'><sup>[201]</sup></a>—has disappeared unnoticed from among the possibilities of
the Faustian world-feeling. Luther could still throw the inkpot at him, but he
has been passed over in silence by perplexed Protestant theologians long ago.
For the <em>solitude</em> of the Faustian soul agrees not at all with a duality of world
powers. God himself is the All. About the end of the 17th Century this religiousness
could no longer be limited to pictorial expression, and instrumental
music came as its last and only form-language: we may say that the Catholic
faith is to the Protestant as an altar-piece is to an oratorio. But even the
Germanic gods and heroes are surrounded by this rebuffing immensity and
enigmatic gloom. They are steeped in music and in night, for daylight gives
visual bounds and therefore shapes bodily things. Night eliminates body, day
soul. Apollo and Athene have no souls. On Olympus rests the eternal light of
the transparent southern day, and Apollo’s hour is high noon, when great Pan
sleeps. But Valhalla is light-less, and even in the Eddas we can trace that deep
midnight of Faust’s study-broodings, the midnight that is caught by Rembrandt’s
etchings and absorbs Beethoven’s tone colours. No Wotan or Baldur
or Freya has “Euclidean” form. Of them, as of the Vedic gods of India, it can
be said that they suffer not “any graven image or any likeness whatsoever”;
and this impossibility carries an implicit recognition that eternal space, and not
the corporeal copy—which levels them down, desecrates them, denies them—is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>the supreme symbol. This is the deep-felt motive that underlies the
iconoclastic storms in Islam and Byzantium (<em>both</em>, be it noted, of the 7th century),
and the closely similar movement in our Protestant North. Was not
Descartes’s creation of the <em>anti-Euclidean</em> analysis of space an iconoclasm? The
Classical geometry handles a number-world of day, the function-theory is the
genuine mathematic of night.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>II</h3>

<p class='c018'>That which is expressed by the soul of the West in its extraordinary wealth
of media—words, tones, colours, pictorial perspectives, philosophical systems,
legends, the spaciousness of Gothic cathedrals and the formulæ of functions—namely
its world-feeling, is expressed by the soul of Old Egypt (which
was remote from all ambitions towards theory and literariness) almost exclusively
by the immediate language of <em>Stone</em>. Instead of spinning word-subtleties
around its form of extension, its “space” and its “time,” instead of forming
hypotheses and number-systems and dogmas, it set up its huge symbols in the
landscape of the Nile in all silence. Stone is the great emblem of the Timeless-Become;
space and death seem bound up in it. “Men have built for the dead,”
says Bachofen in his autobiography, “before they have built for the living, and
even as a perishable wooden structure suffices for the span of time that is given
to the living, so the housing of the dead for ever demands the solid stone of the
earth. The oldest cult is associated with the stone that marks the place of
burial, the oldest temple-building with the tomb-structure, the origins of art
and decoration with the grave-ornament. Symbol has created itself in the
graves. That which is thought and felt and silently prayed at the grave-side
can be expressed by no word, but only hinted by the boding symbol that stands
in unchanging grave repose.” The dead strive no more. They are no more
Time, but only Space—something that stays (if indeed it stays at all) but does
<em>not</em> ripen towards a Future; and hence it is stone, the abiding stone, that expresses
how the dead is mirrored in the waking consciousness of the living.
The Faustian soul looks for an immortality to follow the bodily end, a sort of
marriage with endless space, and it disembodies the stone in its Gothic thrust-system
(contemporary, we may note, with the “consecutives” in Church
music<a id='r202'></a><a href='#f202' class='c019'><sup>[202]</sup></a>) till at last nothing remained visible but the indwelling depth- and
height-energy of this self-extension. The Apollinian soul would have its dead
burned, would see them annihilated, and so it remained averse from stone building
throughout the early period of its Culture. The Egyptian soul saw itself
as moving down a narrow and inexorably-prescribed life-path to come at the
end before the judges of the dead (“Book of the Dead,” cap. 125). That was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>its <em>Destiny-idea</em>. The Egyptian’s existence is that of the traveller who follows
one unchanging direction, and the whole form-language of his Culture is a
translation into the sensible of this one theme. And as we have taken <em>endless
space</em> as the prime symbol of the North and <em>body</em> as that of the Classical, so we
may take the word <em>way</em> as most intelligibly expressing that of the Egyptians.
Strangely, and for Western thought almost incomprehensibly, the one element
in extension that they emphasize is that of direction in depth. The tomb-temples
of the Old Kingdom and especially the mighty pyramid-temples of the
Fourth Dynasty represent, not a purposed organization of space such as we find
in the mosque and the cathedral, but a rhythmically ordered <em>sequence</em> of spaces.
The sacred way leads from the gate-building on the Nile through passages,
halls, arcaded courts and pillared rooms that grow ever narrower and narrower,
to the chamber of the dead,<a id='r203'></a><a href='#f203' class='c019'><sup>[203]</sup></a> and similarly the Sun-temples of the Fifth Dynasty
are not “buildings” but a path enclosed by mighty masonry.<a id='r204'></a><a href='#f204' class='c019'><sup>[204]</sup></a> The reliefs and
the paintings appear always as rows which with an impressive compulsion lead
the beholder in a definite direction. The ram and sphinx avenues of the New
Empire have the same object. For the Egyptian, the depth-experience which
governed his world-form was so emphatically directional that he comprehended
space more or less as a continuous process of actualization. There is nothing
rigid about distance as expressed here. The man must move, and so become
himself a symbol of life, in order to enter into relation with the stone part of the
symbolism. “Way” signifies both Destiny and third dimension. The grand
wall-surfaces, reliefs, colonnades past which he moves are “length and
breadth”; that is, mere perceptions of the senses, and it is the forward-driving
life that <em>extends</em> them into “world.” Thus the Egyptian experienced space,
we may say, in and by the processional march along its distinct elements,
whereas the Greek who sacrificed <em>outside</em> the temple did not feel it and the man
of our Gothic centuries praying in the cathedral let himself be immersed in the
quiet infinity of it. And consequently the art of these Egyptians must aim at
<em>plane</em> effects and nothing else, even when it is making use of solid means. For
the Egyptian, the pyramid over the king’s tomb is a <em>triangle</em>, a huge, powerfully
expressive <em>plane</em> that, whatever be the direction from which one approaches,
closes off the “way” and commands the landscape. For him, the columns of
the inner passages and courts, with their dark backgrounds, their dense array
and their profusion of adornments, appear entirely as vertical strips which
rhythmically accompany the march of the priests. Relief-work is—in utter
contrast to the Classical—carefully restricted in one plane; in the course of
development dated by the Third to the Fifth dynasties it diminishes from the
thickness of a finger to that of a sheet of paper, and finally it is <em>sunk</em> in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>plane.<a id='r205'></a><a href='#f205' class='c019'><sup>[205]</sup></a> The dominance of the horizontal, the vertical and the right angle, and
the avoidance of all foreshortening support the two-dimensional principle and
serve to insulate this directional depth-experience which coincides with the
way and the grave at its end. It is an art that admits of no deviation for the
relief of the tense soul.</p>

<p class='c001'>Is not this an expression in the noblest language that it is possible to conceive
of what all our space-theories would like to put into words? Is it not
a metaphysic in stone by the side of which the written metaphysics of Kant
seems but a helpless stammering?</p>

<p class='c001'>There is, however, another Culture that, different as it most fundamentally
is from the Egyptian, yet found a closely-related prime symbol. This is the
Chinese, with its intensely directional principle of the Tao.<a id='r206'></a><a href='#f206' class='c019'><sup>[206]</sup></a> But whereas the
Egyptian treads to the end a way that is prescribed for him with an inexorable
necessity, the Chinaman <em>wanders</em> through his world; consequently, he is conducted
to his god or his ancestral tomb not by ravines of stone, between faultless
smooth walls, but by friendly Nature herself. Nowhere else has the <em>landscape</em>
become so genuinely the material of the architecture. “Here, on religious
foundations, there has been developed a grand lawfulness and unity common to
all building, which, combined with the strict maintenance of a north-south
general axis, always holds together gate-buildings, side-buildings, courts and
halls in the same homogeneous plan, and has led finally to so grandiose a planning
and such a command over ground and space that one is quite justified in
saying that the artist builds and reckons with the landscape itself.”<a id='r207'></a><a href='#f207' class='c019'><sup>[207]</sup></a> The
temple is not a self-contained building but a lay-out, in which hills, water,
trees, flowers, and stones in definite forms and dispositions are just as important
as gates, walls, bridges and houses. This Culture is the only one in which the
art of gardening is a grand religious art. There are gardens that are reflections
of particular Buddhist sects.<a id='r208'></a><a href='#f208' class='c019'><sup>[208]</sup></a> It is the architecture of the landscape, and only
that, which explains the architecture of the buildings, with their flat extension
and the emphasis laid on the roof as the really expressive element. And just as
the devious ways through doors, over bridges, round hills and walls lead at last
to the end, so the paintings take the beholder from detail to detail whereas
Egyptian relief masterfully points him in the one set direction. “The whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>picture is <em>not</em> to be taken at once. Sequence in time presupposes a sequence of
space-elements through which the eye is to wander from one to the next.”<a id='r209'></a><a href='#f209' class='c019'><sup>[209]</sup></a>
Whereas the Egyptian architecture dominates the landscape, the Chinese espouses
it. But in both cases it is direction in depth that maintains the <em>becoming</em>
of space as a continuously-present experience.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>III</h3>

<p class='c018'>All art is <em>expression-language</em>.<a id='r210'></a><a href='#f210' class='c019'><sup>[210]</sup></a> Moreover, in its very earliest essays—which
extend far back into the animal world—it is that of one active existence speaking
for itself only, and it is unconscious of witnesses even though in the absence
of such the impulse to expression would not come to utterance. Even in quite
“late” conditions we often see, instead of the combination of artist and spectator,
a crowd of art-makers who <em>all</em> dance or mime or sing. The idea of the
“Chorus” as sum total of persons present has never entirely vanished from
art-history. It is only the higher art that becomes decisively an art “before
witnesses” and especially (as Nietzsche somewhere remarks) before God as the
supreme witness.<a id='r211'></a><a href='#f211' class='c019'><sup>[211]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>This expression is either <em>ornament</em> or <em>imitation</em>. Both are <em>higher</em> possibilities
and their polarity to one another is hardly perceptible in the beginnings. Of
the two, imitation is definitely the earlier and the closer to the producing race.
Imitation is the outcome of a physiognomic idea of a second person with whom
(or which) the first is involuntarily induced into resonance of vital rhythm
(mitschwingen <a id='corr191.22'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='in'>im</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_191.22'>im</a></span>); whereas ornament evidences an ego conscious
of its own specific character. The former is widely spread in the animal world,
the latter almost peculiar to man.</p>

<p class='c001'>Imitation is born of the secret rhythm of all things cosmic. For the waking
being the One appears as discrete and extended; there is a Here and a There, a
Proper and an Alien something, a Microcosm and a Macrocosm that are polar
to one another in the sense-life, and what the rhythm of imitation does is to
bridge this dichotomy. Every religion is an effort of the waking soul to reach
the powers of the world-around. And so too is Imitation, which in its most
devoted moments is wholly religious, for it consists in an identity of inner
activity between the soul and body “here” and the world-around “there”
which, vibrating as one, become one. As a bird poises itself in the storm or a
float gives to the swaying waves, so our limbs take up an irresistible beat at the
sound of march-music. Not less contagious is the imitation of another’s bearing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>and movements, wherein children in particular excel. It reaches the superlative
when we “let ourselves go” in the common song or parade-march or dance
that creates out of many units one unit of feeling and expression, a “we.” But
a “successful” picture of a man or a landscape is also the outcome of a felt
harmony of the pictorial motion with the secret swing and sway of the living
opposite; and it is this actualizing of physiognomic rhythm that requires the
executant to be an adept who can reveal the idea, the <em>soul</em>, of the alien in the
play of its surface. In certain unreserved moments we are all adepts of this sort,
and in such moments, as we follow in an imperceptible rhythm the music and
the play of facial expression, we suddenly look over the precipice and see great
secrets. The aim of all imitation is effective simulation; this means effective
assimilation of ourselves into an alien something—such a transposition and
transubstantiation that the One lives henceforth in the Other that it describes
or depicts—and it is able to awaken an intense feeling of unison over all the
range from silent absorption and acquiescence to the most abandoned laughter
and down into the last depths of the erotic, a unison which is inseparable from
creative activity. In this wise arose the popular circling-dances (for instance,
the Bavarian <span lang="de"><i>Schuhplattler</i></span> was originally imitated from the courtship of the
woodcocks) but this too is what Vasari means when he praises Cimabue and
Giotto as the first who returned to the imitation of “Nature”—the Nature,
that is, of springtime men, of which Meister Eckart said: “God flows out in all
creatures, and therefore all created is God.” That which in this world-around
presents itself to our contemplation—and therefore contains meaning for our
feelings—as movement, we render by movement. Hence all imitation is in
the broadest sense dramatic; drama is presented in the movement of the brush-stroke
or the chisel, the melodic curve of the song, the tone of the recitation,
the line of poetry, the description, the dance. But everything that we <em>experience</em>
with and in seeings and hearings is always an alien soul to which we
are uniting ourselves. It is only at the stage of the Megalopolis that art,
reasoned to pieces and de-spiritualized, goes over to naturalism as that term is
understood nowadays; viz., imitation of the charm of visible appearances, of
the stock of sensible characters that are capable of being scientifically fixed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ornament detaches itself now from Imitation as something which does not
follow the stream of life but rigidly <em>faces it</em>. Instead of physiognomic traits
overheard in the alien being, we have established motives, <em>symbols</em>, which are
impressed upon it. The intention is no longer to pretend but to conjure. The
“I” overwhelms the “Thou.” Imitation is only a <em>speaking</em> with means that
are born of the moment and unreproduceable—but Ornament <em>employs a language</em>
emancipated from the speaking, a stock of forms that possesses duration
and is not at the mercy of the individual.<a id='r212'></a><a href='#f212' class='c019'><sup>[212]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Only the <em>living</em> can be imitated, and it can be imitated only in movements,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>for it is through these that it reveals itself to the senses of artists and spectators.
To that extent, imitation belongs to Time and Direction. All the dancing and
drawing and describing and portraying for eye and ear is irrevocably “directional,”
and hence the highest possibilities of Imitation lie in the copying of
a destiny, be it in tones, verses, picture or stage-scene.<a id='r213'></a><a href='#f213' class='c019'><sup>[213]</sup></a> Ornament, on the contrary,
is something taken away from Time: it is pure extension, settled and
stable. Whereas an imitation expresses something by <em>accomplishing itself</em>, ornament
can only do so by presenting itself to the senses as a finished thing. It is
Being as such, wholly independent of origin. Every imitation possesses beginning
and end, while an ornament possesses only duration, and therefore we
can only imitate the destiny of an <em>individual</em> (for instance, Antigone or Desdemona),
while by an ornament or symbol only the generalized destiny-idea
itself can be represented (as, for example, that of the Classical world by the
Doric column). And the former presupposes a talent, while the latter calls for
an acquirable knowledge as well.</p>

<p class='c001'>All strict arts have their grammar and syntax of form-language, with rules
and laws, inward logic and tradition. This is true not merely for the Doric
cabin-temple and Gothic cottage-cathedral, for the carving-schools of Egypt<a id='r214'></a><a href='#f214' class='c019'><sup>[214]</sup></a>
and Athens and the cathedral plastic of northern France, for the painting-schools
of the Classical world and those of Holland and the Rhine and Florence,
but also for the fixed rules of the Skalds and Minnesänger which were learned
and practised as a craft (and dealt not merely with sentence and metre but also
with gesture and the choice of imagery<a id='r215'></a><a href='#f215' class='c019'><sup>[215]</sup></a>), for the narration-technique of the
Vedic, Homeric and Celto-Germanic Epos, for the composition and delivery of
the Gothic sermon (both vernacular and Latin), and for the orators’ prose<a id='r216'></a><a href='#f216' class='c019'><sup>[216]</sup></a> in
the Classical, and for the rules of French drama. In the ornamentation of an
art-work is reflected the inviolable causality of the macrocosm as the man of
the particular kind sees and comprehends it. Both have system. Each is penetrated
with the religious side of life—<em>fear</em> and love.<a id='r217'></a><a href='#f217' class='c019'><sup>[217]</sup></a> A genuine symbol can
instil fear or can set free from fear; the “right” emancipates and the “wrong”
hurts and depresses. The imitative side of the arts, on the contrary, stands
closer to the real race-feelings of <em>hate</em> and love, out of which arises the opposition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>of <em>ugly</em> and <em>beautiful</em>. This is in relation only with the living, of which the
inner rhythm repels us or draws us into phase with it, whether it be that of the
sunset-cloud or that of the tense breath of the machine. An imitation is beautiful,
an ornament <em>significant</em>, and therein lies the difference between direction
and extension, organic and inorganic logic, life and death. That which we
think beautiful is “worth copying.” Easily it swings with us and draws us on
to imitate, to join in the singing, to repeat. Our hearts beat higher, our limbs
twitch, and we are stirred till our spirits overflow. But as it belongs to Time,
it “has its time.” A symbol endures, but everything beautiful vanishes with
the life-pulsation of the man, the class, the people or the race that feels it as a
specific beauty in the general cosmic rhythm.<a id='r218'></a><a href='#f218' class='c019'><sup>[218]</sup></a> The “beauty” that Classical
sculpture and poetry contained for Classical eyes is something different from
the beauty that they contain for ours—something extinguished irrecoverably
with the Classical soul—while what we regard as beautiful in it is something
that only exists for us. Not only is that which is beautiful for one kind
of man neutral or ugly for another—e.g., the whole of our music for the
Chinese, or Mexican sculpture for us. For <em>one and the same life</em> the accustomed,
the habitual, owing to the very fact of its possessing duration, cannot possess
beauty.</p>

<p class='c001'>And now for the first time we can see the opposition between these two sides
of every art in all its depth. Imitation spiritualizes and quickens, ornament
enchants and kills. The one becomes, the other is. And therefore the one is
allied to love and, above all—in songs and riot and dance—to the <em>sexual
love</em>, which turns existence to face the future; and the other to care of the past,
to recollection<a id='r219'></a><a href='#f219' class='c019'><sup>[219]</sup></a> and to the <em>funerary</em>. The beautiful is longingly pursued, the
significant instils dread, and there is no deeper contrast than that between the
house of the living and the house of the dead.<a id='r220'></a><a href='#f220' class='c019'><sup>[220]</sup></a> The peasant’s cottage<a id='r221'></a><a href='#f221' class='c019'><sup>[221]</sup></a> and its
derivative the country noble’s hall, the fenced town and the castle are mansions
of life, unconscious expressions of circling blood, that no art produced
and no art can alter. The idea of the family appears in the plan of the proto-house,
the inner form of the stock in the plan of its villages—which after
many a century and many a change of occupation still show what race it
was that founded them<a id='r222'></a><a href='#f222' class='c019'><sup>[222]</sup></a>—the life of a nation and its social ordering in the
plan (<em>not</em> the elevation or silhouette) of the city.<a id='r223'></a><a href='#f223' class='c019'><sup>[223]</sup></a> On the other hand, Ornamentation
of the high order develops itself on the stiff symbols of death,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>the urn, the sarcophagus, the stele and the temple of the dead,<a id='r224'></a><a href='#f224' class='c019'><sup>[224]</sup></a> and beyond
these in gods’ temples and cathedrals <em>which are Ornament through and through</em>,
not the expressions of a race but the language of a world-view. They are
pure art through and through—just what the castle and the cottage are
not.<a id='r225'></a><a href='#f225' class='c019'><sup>[225]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>For cottage and castle are <em>buildings in which</em> art, and, specifically, imitative
art, is <em>made and done</em>, the home of Vedic, Homeric and Germanic epos, of the
songs of heroes, the dance of boors and that of lords and ladies, of the minstrel’s
lay. The cathedral, on the other hand, <em>is</em> art, and, moreover, the only
art by which <em>nothing</em> is imitated; it alone is pure tension of persistent forms,
pure three-dimensional logic that expresses itself in edges and surfaces and
volumes. But the art of villages and castles is derived from the inclinations
of the moment, from the laughter and high spirit of feasts and games,
and to such a degree is it dependent on Time, so much is it a thing of
occasion, that the troubadour obtains his very name from finding, while
Improvisation—as we see in the Tzigane music to-day—is nothing but
race manifesting itself to alien senses under the influence of the hour. To
this free creative power all spiritual art opposes the strict <em>school</em> in which
the individual—in the hymn as in the work of building and carving—is
the servant of a logic of timeless forms, and so in all Cultures the seat of
its style-history is in its early cult architecture. In the castle it is the life
and not the structure that possesses style. In the town the plan is an image
of the destinies of a people, whereas the silhouette of emergent spires and
cupolas tells of the <i>logic in the builders’ world-picture</i>, of the “first and last
things” of their universe.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the architecture of the living, stone <em>serves a</em> worldly <em>purpose</em>, but in the
architecture of the cult <em>it is a symbol</em>.<a id='r226'></a><a href='#f226' class='c019'><sup>[226]</sup></a> Nothing has injured the history of the
great architectures so much as the fact that it has been regarded as the history
of architectural techniques instead of as that of architectural ideas which took
their technical expression-means as and where they found them. It has been
just the same with the history of musical instruments,<a id='r227'></a><a href='#f227' class='c019'><sup>[227]</sup></a> which also were developed
on a foundation of tone-language. Whether the groin and the flying
buttress and the squinch-cupola were imagined specially for the great architectures
or were expedients that lay more or less ready to hand and were taken
into use, is for art-history a matter of as little importance as the question of
whether, technically, stringed instruments originated in Arabia or in Celtic
Britain. It may be that the Doric column was, as a matter of workmanship,
borrowed from the Egyptian temples of the New Empire, or the late-Roman
domical construction from the Etruscans, or the Florentine court from the
North-African Moors. Nevertheless the Doric peripteros, the Pantheon, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>the Palazzo Farnese belong to wholly different worlds—they subserve the
artistic expression of the prime-symbol in three different Cultures.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>IV</h3>

<p class='c018'>In every springtime, consequently, there are <em>two</em> definitely ornamental and
non-imitative arts, that of building and that of decoration. In the longing and
pregnant centuries before it, elemental expression belongs exclusively to Ornamentation
in the narrow sense. The Carolingian period is represented only by
its ornament, as its architecture, for want of the <em>Idea</em>, stands between the styles.
And similarly, as a matter of art-history, it is immaterial that no buildings of
the Mycenæan age have survived.<a id='r228'></a><a href='#f228' class='c019'><sup>[228]</sup></a> But with the dawn of the great Culture,
<em>architecture as ornament</em> comes into being suddenly and with such a force of expression
that for a century mere decoration-as-such shrinks away from it in
awe. The spaces, surfaces and edges of stone speak <em>alone</em>. The tomb of Chephren
is the culmination of mathematical simplicity—everywhere right angles,
squares and rectangular pillars, nowhere adornment, inscription or desinence—and
it is only after some generations have passed that Relief ventures to infringe
the solemn magic of those spaces and the strain begins to be eased. And
the noble Romanesque of Westphalia-Saxony (Hildesheim, Gernrode, Paulinzella,
Paderborn), of Southern France and of the Normans (Norwich and
Peterborough) managed to render the whole sense of the world with indescribable
power and dignity in <em>one</em> line, <em>one</em> capital, <em>one</em> arch.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the form-world of the springtime is at its highest, and not before, the
ordained relation is that architecture is lord and ornament is vassal. And the
word “ornament” is to be taken here in the widest possible sense. Even conventionally,
it covers the Classical <em>unit</em>-motive with its quiet poised symmetry
or meander supplement, the <em>spun surface</em> of arabesque and the not dissimilar surface-patterning
of Mayan art, and the “Thunder-pattern”<a id='r229'></a><a href='#f229' class='c019'><sup>[229]</sup></a> and others of the
early Chóu period which prove once again the landscape basis of the old
Chinese architecture without a doubt. But the warrior figures of Dipylon vases
are also conceived in the spirit of ornament, and so, in a far higher degree still,
are the statuary <em>groups</em> of Gothic cathedrals. “The figures were composed pillarwise
from the spectator, the figures of the pillar being, with reference to the spectator,
ranked upon one another like rhythmic figures in a symphony that soars
heavenward and expands its sounds in every direction.”<a id='r230'></a><a href='#f230' class='c019'><sup>[230]</sup></a> And besides draperies,
gestures, and figure-types, even the structure of the hymn-strophe and the
parallel motion of the parts in church music are ornament in the service of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>all-ruling architectural idea.<a id='r231'></a><a href='#f231' class='c019'><sup>[231]</sup></a> The spell of the great Ornamentation remains
unbroken till in the beginning of a “late” period architecture falls into a <em>group</em>
of civic and worldly special arts that unceasingly devote themselves to pleasing
and clever imitation and become <span lang="la"><i>ipso facto</i></span> personal. To Imitation and Ornament
the same applies that has been said already of time and space. Time gives
birth to space, but space gives death to time.<a id='r232'></a><a href='#f232' class='c019'><sup>[232]</sup></a> In the beginning, rigid symbolism
had petrified everything alive; the Gothic statue was not permitted to be a
living body, but was simply a set of lines disposed in human form. But now
Ornament loses all its sacred rigour and becomes more and more decoration
for the architectural setting of a polite and mannered life. It was purely as this,
namely <em>as a beautifying</em> element, that Renaissance taste was adopted by the
courtly and patrician world of the North (and by it alone!). Ornament meant
something quite different in the Egyptian Old Kingdom from what it meant in
the Middle; in the geometric period from what it meant in the Hellenistic; at
the end of the 12th Century from what it meant at the end of Louis XIV’s reign.
And architecture too becomes pictorial and makes music, and its forms seem
always to be trying to imitate something in the picture of the world-around.
From the Ionic capital we proceed to the Corinthian, and from Vignola through
Bernini to the Rococo.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the last, when Civilization sets in, true ornament and, with it, great art
as a whole are extinguished. The transition consists—in every Culture—in
Classicism and Romanticism of one sort or another, the former being a sentimental
regard for an Ornamentation (rules, laws, types) that has long been
archaic and soulless, and the latter a sentimental Imitation, not of life, but of an
older Imitation. In the place of architectural style we find architectural taste.
Methods of painting and mannerisms of writing, old forms and new, home and
foreign, come and go with the fashion. The inward necessity is no longer there,
there are no longer “schools,” for everyone selects what and where it pleases
him to select. <em>Art becomes craft-art</em> (<span lang="de"><i>Kunstgewerbe</i></span>) in all its branches—architecture
and music, poetry and drama—and in the end we have a pictorial and
literary stock-in-trade which is destitute of any deeper significance and is employed
according to taste. This final or industrial form of Ornament—no
longer historical, no longer in the condition of “becoming”—we have before
us not only in the patterns of oriental carpets, Persian and Indian metal work,`
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>Chinese porcelain, but also in Egyptian (and Babylonian) art as the Greeks and
Romans met it. The Minoan art of Crete is pure craft-art, a northern outlier of
Egyptian post-Hyksos taste; and its “contemporary,” Hellenistic-Roman art
from about the time of Scipio and Hannibal, similarly subserves the habit of
comfort and the play of intellect. From the richly-decorated entablature of the
Forum of Nerva in Rome to the later provincial ceramics in the West, we can
trace the same steady formation of an unalterable craft-art that we find in the
Egyptian and the Islamic worlds, and that we have to presume in India after
Buddha and in China after Confucius.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>V</h4>

<p class='c018'>Now, Cathedral and Pyramid-temple are different in spite of their deep inward
kinship, and it is precisely in these differences that we seize the mighty
phenomenon of the Faustian soul, whose depth-impulse refuses to be bound in
the prime symbol of a way, and from its earliest beginnings strives to transcend
every optical limitation. Can anything be more alien to the Egyptian conception
of the State—whose tendency we may describe as a noble sobriety—than
the political ambitions of the great Saxon, Franconian and Hohenstaufen
Emperors, who came to grief because they overleapt all political actualities and
for whom the recognition of any bounds would have been a betrayal of the idea
of their rulership? Here the prime symbol of infinite space, with all its indescribable
power, entered the field of active political existence. Beside the
figures of the Ottos, Conrad II, Henry VI and Frederick II stand the Viking-Normans,
conquerors of Russia, Greenland, England, Sicily and almost of
Constantinople; and the great popes, Gregory VII and Innocent III—all of
whom alike aimed at making their visible spheres of influence coincident with
the whole known world. This is what distinguishes the heroes of the Grail and
Arthurian and Siegfried sagas, ever roaming in the infinite, from the heroes of
Homer with their geographically modest horizon; and the Crusades, that took
men from the Elbe and the Loire to the limits of the known world, from the
historical events upon which the Classical soul built the “Iliad” and which
from the style of that soul we may safely assume to have been local, bounded,
and completely appreciable.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Doric soul actualized the symbol of the corporally-present individual
thing, while deliberately rejecting all big and far-reaching creations, and it is
for this very good reason that the first post-Mycenæan period has bequeathed
nothing to our archæologists. The expression to which this soul finally attained
was the Doric temple with its purely outward effectiveness, set upon the landscape
as a massive image but denying and artistically disregarding the space
within as the μὴ ὄv, that which was held to be incapable of existence. The
ranked columns of the Egyptians carried the roof of a hall. The Greek in borrowing
the motive invested it with a meaning proper to himself—he turned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>the architectural type inside out like a glove. The outer column-sets are, in a
sense, relics of a denied interior.<a id='r233'></a><a href='#f233' class='c019'><sup>[233]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The Magian and the Faustian souls, on the contrary, built high. Their
dream-images became concrete as vaultings above significant inner-spaces,
structural anticipations respectively of the mathematic of algebra and that of
analysis. In the style that radiated from Burgundy and Flanders rib-vaulting
with its lunettes and flying buttresses emancipated the contained space from the
sense-appreciable surface<a id='r234'></a><a href='#f234' class='c019'><sup>[234]</sup></a> bounding it. In the Magian interior "the window is
merely a negative component, a utility-form in no wise yet developed into an
art-form—to put it crudely, nothing but a hole in the wall."<a id='r235'></a><a href='#f235' class='c019'><sup>[235]</sup></a> When windows
were in practice indispensable, they were for the sake of artistic impression
concealed by galleries as in the Eastern basilica.<a id='r236'></a><a href='#f236' class='c019'><sup>[236]</sup></a> The <em>window as architecture</em>, on
the other hand, is peculiar to the Faustian soul and the most significant symbol
of its depth-experience. In it can be felt the will to emerge from the interior
into the boundless. The same will that is immanent in contrapuntal music was
native to these vaultings. The incorporeal world of this music was and remained
that of the first Gothic, and even when, much later, polyphonic music
rose to such heights as those of the Matthew Passion, the Eroica, and Tristan
and Parsifal, it became of inward necessity <em>cathedral-like</em> and returned to its
home, the stone language of the Crusade-time. To get rid of every trace of
Classical corporeality, there was brought to bear the full force of a deeply
significant Ornamentation, which defies the delimiting power of stone with its
weirdly impressive transformations of vegetal, animal and human bodies (St.
Pierre in Moissac), which dissolves all its lines into melodies and variations on
a theme, all its façades into many-voiced fugues, and all the bodiliness of its
statuary into a music of drapery-folds. It is this spirituality that gave their
deep meaning to the gigantic glass-expanses of our cathedral-windows with
their polychrome, <em>translucent and therefore wholly bodiless</em>, painting—an art that
has never and nowhere repeated itself and forms the completest contrast that
can be imagined to the Classical fresco. It is perhaps in the Sainte-Chapelle at
Paris that this emancipation from bodiliness is most evident. Here the stone
practically vanishes in the gleam of the glass. Whereas the fresco-painting is
co-material with the wall on and with which it has grown and its colour is
effective as material, here we have colours dependent on no carrying surface
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>but as free in space as organ notes, and shapes poised in the infinite. Compare
with the Faustian spirit of these churches—almost wall-less, loftily vaulted,
irradiated with many-coloured light, aspiring from nave to choir—the Arabian
(that is, the Early-Christian Byzantine) cupola-church. The pendentive
cupola, that seems to float on high above the basilica or the octagon, was
indeed also a victory over the principle of natural gravity which the Classical
expressed in architrave and column; it, too, was a defiance of architectural body,
of “exterior.” But the very absence of an exterior emphasizes the more the
unbroken coherence of the wall that shuts in the Cavern and allows no look and
no hope to emerge from it. An ingeniously confusing interpenetration of
spherical and polygonal forms; a load so placed upon a stone drum that it
seems to hover weightless on high, yet closing the interior without outlet; all
structural lines concealed; vague light admitted, through a small opening in
the heart of the dome but only the more inexorably to emphasize the walling-in—such
are the characters that we see in the masterpieces of this art, S. Vitale
in Ravenna, <a id='corr200.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Hagia S Sophia'>Hagia Sophia</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_200.16'>Hagia Sophia</a></span> in Constantinople, and the Dome of the Rock<a id='r237'></a><a href='#f237' class='c019'><sup>[237]</sup></a> in
Jerusalem. Where the Egyptian puts reliefs that with their flat planes studiously
avoid any foreshortening suggestive of lateral depth, where the Gothic
architects put their pictures of glass to draw in the world of space without,
the Magian clothes his walls with sparkling, predominantly golden, mosaics
and arabesques and so drowns his cavern in that unreal, fairy-tale light which
for Northerners is always so seductive in Moorish art.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>VI</h3>

<p class='c018'>The phenomenon of the <em>great style</em>, then, is an emanation from the essence
of the Macrocosm, from the prime-symbol of a <em>great</em> culture. No one who can
appreciate the connotation of the word sufficiently to see that it designates not
a form-aggregate but a form-history, will try to aline the fragmentary and
chaotic art-utterances of primitive mankind with the comprehensive certainty
of a style that consistently develops over centuries. Only the art of great
Cultures, the art that has ceased to be only art and has begun to be an effective
unit of expression and significance, possesses style.</p>

<p class='c001'>The organic history of a style comprises a "pre—," a "non—" and a
"post—." The bull tablet of the First Dynasty of Egypt<a id='r238'></a><a href='#f238' class='c019'><sup>[238]</sup></a> is not yet “Egyptian.”
Not till the Third Dynasty do the works acquire a style—but then they
do so suddenly and very definitely. Similarly the Carolingian period stands
“between-styles.” We see different forms touched on and explored, but nothing
of inwardly necessary expression. The creator of the Aachen Minster “thinks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>surely and builds surely, but does not feel surely.”<a id='r239'></a><a href='#f239' class='c019'><sup>[239]</sup></a> The Marienkirche in the
Castle of Würzburg (c. 700) has its counterpart in Salonika (St. George), and
the Church of St. Germigny des Près (c. 800) with its cupolas and horseshoe
niches is almost a mosque. For the whole of West Europe the period 850-950
is almost a blank. And just so to-day Russian art stands between two styles.
The primitive wooden architecture with its steep eight-sided tent-roof (which
extends from Norway to Manchuria) is impressed with Byzantine motives from
over the Danube and Armenian-Persian from over the Caucasus. We can certainly
feel an “elective affinity” between the Russian and the Magian souls,
but as yet the prime symbol of Russia, the <em>plane without limit</em>,<a id='r240'></a><a href='#f240' class='c019'><sup>[240]</sup></a> finds no sure
expression either in religion or in architecture. The church roof emerges, hillock-wise,
but little from the landscape and on it sit the tent-roofs whose points
are coifed with the “kokoshniks” that suppress and would abolish the upward
tendency. They neither tower up like the Gothic belfry nor enclose like the
mosque-cupola, but <em>sit</em>, thereby emphasizing the horizontality of the building,
which is meant to be regarded merely from the outside. When about 1760 the
Synod forbade the tent roofs and prescribed the orthodox onion-cupolas, the
heavy cupolas were set upon slender cylinders, of which there may be any
number<a id='r241'></a><a href='#f241' class='c019'><sup>[241]</sup></a> and which sit on the roof-plane.<a id='r242'></a><a href='#f242' class='c019'><sup>[242]</sup></a> It is not yet a style, only the
promise of a style that will awaken when the real Russian religion awakens.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the Faustian West, this awakening happened shortly before <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1000.
In one moment, the Romanesque style was there. Instead of the fluid organization
of space on an insecure ground plan, there was, suddenly, a strict dynamic
of space. From the very beginning, inner and outer construction were placed in
a fixed relation, the wall was penetrated by the form-language and the form
worked into the wall in a way that no other Culture has ever imagined. From
the very beginning the window and the belfry were invested with their meanings.
The form was irrevocably assigned. Only its development remained to
be worked out.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Egyptian style began with another such creative act, just as unconscious,
just as full of symbolic force. The prime symbol of the Way came into being
suddenly with the beginning of the Fourth Dynasty (2930 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>). The world-creating
depth-experience of this soul gets its substance from the direction-factor
itself. Spatial depth as stiffened Time, distance, death, Destiny itself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>dominate the expression, and the merely sensuous dimensions of length and
breadth become an escorting plane which restricts and prescribes the Way of
destiny. The Egyptian flat-relief, which is designed to be seen at close quarters
and arranged serially so as to compel the beholder to pass along the wall-planes
in the prescribed direction, appears with similar suddenness about the beginning
of the Fifth Dynasty.<a id='r243'></a><a href='#f243' class='c019'><sup>[243]</sup></a> The still later avenues of sphinxes and statues and
the rock- and terrace-temples constantly intensify that tendency towards the
one distance that the world of Egyptian mankind knows, the grave. Observe
how soon the colonnades of the early period come to be systems of huge,
close-set pillars that <em>screen off</em> all side-view. This is something that has never
reproduced itself in any other architecture.</p>

<p class='c001'>The grandeur of this style appears to us as rigid and unchanging. And certainly
it stands beyond the passion which is ever seeking and fearing and so
imparts to subordinate characters a quality of restless personal movement in the
flow of the centuries. But, vice versa, we cannot doubt that to an Egyptian the
Faustian style (which <em>is</em> our style, from earliest Romanesque to Rococo and
Empire) would with its unresting persistent search for a Something, appear far
more uniform than we can imagine. It follows, we must not forget, from the
conception of style that we are working on here, that Romanesque, Gothic,
Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo are only <em>stages of one and the same style</em>, in
which it is naturally the variable that we and the constant that men of other
eyes remark. In actual fact, the inner unity of the Northern Renaissance is
shown in innumerable reconstructions of Romanesque work in Baroque and of
late Gothic work in Rococo that are not in the least startling. In peasant art,
Gothic and Baroque have been identical, and the streets of old towns with their
pure harmony of all sorts of gables and façades (wherein definite attributions
to Romanesque or Gothic Renaissance or Baroque or Rococo are often quite
impossible) show that the family resemblance between the members is far
greater than they themselves realize.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Egyptian style was purely architectural, and remained so till the Egyptian
soul was extinguished. It is the only one in which Ornamentation as a
decorative supplement to architecture is entirely absent. It allowed of no divergence
into arts of entertainment, no display-painting, no busts, no secular
music. In the Ionic phase, the centre of gravity of the Classical style shifted
from architecture to an independent plastic art; in that of the Baroque the style
of the West passed into music, whose form-language in its turn ruled the entire
building art of the 18th Century; in the Arabian world, after Justinian and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>Chosroes-Nushirvan, Arabesque dissolved all the forms of architecture, painting
and sculpture into style-impressions that nowadays we should consider as
craft-art. But in Egypt the sovereignty of architecture remained unchallenged;
it merely softened its language a little. In the chambers of the pyramid-temple
of the Fourth Dynasty (Pyramid of Chephren) there are unadorned angular
pillars. In the buildings of the Fifth (Pyramid of Sahu-rê) the plant-column
makes its appearance. Lotus and papyrus branches turned into stone arise
gigantic out of a pavement of transparent alabaster that represents water,
enclosed by purple walls. The ceiling is adorned with birds and stars. The
sacred way from the gate-buildings to the tomb-chamber, the picture of life, is
a stream—it is the Nile itself become one with the prime-symbol of direction.
The spirit of the mother-landscape unites with the soul that has sprung
from it.</p>

<p class='c001'>In China, in lieu of the awe-inspiring pylon with its massy wall and narrow
entrance, we have the “Spirit-wall” (yin-pi) that conceals the way in. The
Chinaman slips into life and thereafter follows the Tao of life’s path; as the
Nile valley is to the up-and-down landscape of the Hwang Ho, so is the stone-enclosed
temple-way to the mazy paths of Chinese garden-architecture. And
just so, in some mysterious fashion, the Euclidean existence is linked with the
multitude of little islands and promontories of the Ægean, and the passionate
Western, roving in the infinite, with the broad plains of Franconia and
Burgundy and Saxony.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>VII</h4>

<p class='c018'>The Egyptian style is the expression of a <em>brave</em> soul. The rigour and force of
it Egyptian man himself never felt and never asserted. He dared all, but said
nothing. In Gothic and Baroque, on the contrary, the triumph over heaviness
became a perfectly conscious motive of the form-language. The drama of
Shakespeare deals openly with the desperate conflict of will and world. Classical
man, again, was weak in the face of the “powers.” The κάθαρσις of fear
and pity, the <em>relief and recovery</em> of the Apollinian soul in the moment of the
περιπέτεια was, according to Aristotle, the effect deliberately aimed at in
Attic tragedy. As the Greek spectator watched <em>someone whom he knew</em> (for everyone
knew the myth and its heroes and lived in them) senselessly maltreated by
fortune, without any conceivable possibility of resistance to the Powers, and
saw him go under with splendid mien, defiant, heroic, his own Euclidean soul
experienced a marvellous uplifting. If life was worthless, at any rate the <em>grand
gesture</em> in losing it was not so. The Greek willed nothing and dared nothing,
but he found a stirring beauty in <em>enduring</em>. Even the earlier figures of Odysseus
the patient, and, above all, Achilles the archetype of Greek manhood, have
this characteristic quality. The morale of the Cynics, that of the Stoics, that
of Epicurus, the common Greek ideals of σωφροσύνη and ἀταραξἰα, Diogenes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>devoting himself to θεωρία in a tub—all this is masked cowardice in the face
of grave matters and responsibilities, and different indeed from the pride of the
Egyptian soul. Apollinian man goes below ground out of life’s way, even to
the point of suicide, which <em>in this Culture alone</em> (if we ignore certain related Indian
ideals) ranked as a high ethical act and was treated with the solemnity of
a ritual symbol.<a id='r244'></a><a href='#f244' class='c019'><sup>[244]</sup></a> The Dionysiac intoxication seems a sort of furious drowning
of uneasinesses that to the Egyptian soul were utterly unknown. And consequently
the Greek Culture is that of the small, the easy, the simple. Its
technique is, compared with Egyptian or Babylonian, a clever nullity.<a id='r245'></a><a href='#f245' class='c019'><sup>[245]</sup></a> No
ornamentation shows such a poverty of invention as theirs, and their stock of
sculptural positions and attitudes could be counted on one’s fingers. “In its
poverty of forms, which is conspicuous even allowing that at the beginning of
its development it may have been better off than it was later, the Doric style
pivoted everything on proportions and on measure.”<a id='r246'></a><a href='#f246' class='c019'><sup>[246]</sup></a> Yet, even so, what
adroitness in avoiding! The Greek architecture with its commensuration of
load and support and its peculiar smallness of scale suggests a persistent
evasion of difficult architectural problems that on the Nile and, later, in the
high North were literally looked for, which moreover were known and certainly
not burked in the Mycenæan age. The Egyptian loved the strong
stone of immense buildings; it was in keeping with his self-consciousness that
he should choose only the hardest for his task. But the Greek avoided it; his
architecture first set itself small tasks, then ceased altogether. If we survey it
as a whole, and then compare it with the totality of Egyptian or Mexican
or even, for that matter, Western architecture, we are astounded at the feeble
development of the style. A few variations of the Doric temple and it was
exhausted. It was already closed off about 400 when the Corinthian capital
was invented, and everything subsequent to this was merely modification of
what existed.</p>

<p class='c001'>The result of this was an almost bodily standardization of form-types and
style-species. One might choose between them, but never overstep their strict
limits—that would have been in some sort an admission of an infinity of
possibilities. There were three orders of columns and a definite disposition of
the architrave corresponding to each; to deal with the difficulty (considered,
as early as Vitruvius, as a conflict) which the alternation of triglyphs and
metopes produced at the corners, the nearest intercolumniations were narrowed—no
one thought of imagining new forms to suit the case. If greater dimensions
were desired, the requirements were met by superposition, juxtaposition,
etc., of additional elements. Thus the Colosseum possesses three rings, the
Didymæum of Miletus three rows of columns in front, and the Frieze of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>Giants of Pergamum an endless succession of individual and unconnected
motives. Similarly with the style-species of prose and the types of lyric poetry,
narrative and tragedy. Universally, the expenditure of powers on the basic
form is restricted to the minimum and the creative energy of the artist directed
to detail-fineness. It is a statical treatment of static genera, and it stands in
the sharpest possible contrast to the dynamic fertility of the Faustian with
its ceaseless creation of new types and domains of form.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>VIII</h4>

<p class='c018'>We are now able to see the <em>organism</em> in a great style-course. Here, as in
so many other matters, Goethe was the first to whom vision came. In his
“Winckelmann” he says of Velleius Paterculus: “with his standpoint, it was
not given to him to see all art as a living thing (ζῶον) that must have an inconspicuous
beginning, a slow growth, a brilliant moment of fulfilment and a
gradual decline like every other organic being, though it is presented in a set
of individuals.” This sentence contains the entire morphology of art-history.
Styles do not follow one another like waves or pulse-beats. It is not the personality
or will or brain of the artist that makes the style, but the style that
makes the <em>type</em> of the artist. The style, like the Culture, is a prime phenomenon
in the strictest Goethian sense, be it the style of art or religion or thought, or
the style of life itself. It is, as “Nature” is, an ever-new experience of waking
man, his alter ego and mirror-image in the world-around. And therefore in
the general historical picture of a Culture there can be but one style, <em>the style
of the Culture</em>. The error has lain in treating mere style-phases—Romanesque,
Gothic, Baroque, Rococo, Empire—as if they were styles on the same level
as units of quite another order such as the Egyptian, the Chinese (or even a
“prehistoric”) style. Gothic and Baroque are simply the youth and age of one
and the same vessel of forms, the style of the West as ripening and ripened.
What has been wanting in our art-research has been detachment, freedom from
prepossessions, and the will to abstract. Saving ourselves trouble, we have
classed any and every form-domain that makes a strong impression upon us as
a “style,” and it need hardly be said that our insight has been led astray still
further by the Ancient-Mediæval-Modern scheme. But in reality, even a
masterpiece of strictest Renaissance like the court of the Palazzo Farnese is
infinitely nearer to the arcade-porch of St. Patroclus in Soest, the interior of
the Magdeburg cathedral, and the staircases of South-German castles of the
18th Century than it is to the Temple of Pæstum or to the Erechtheum. The
same relation exists between Doric and Ionic, and hence Ionic columns can be as
completely combined with Doric building forms as late Gothic is with early
Baroque in St. Lorenz at Nürnberg, or late Romanesque with late Baroque
in the beautiful upper part of the West choir at Mainz. And our eyes have
scarcely yet learned to distinguish within the Egyptian style the Old Kingdom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>and Middle Empire elements corresponding to Doric and Gothic youth
and to Ionic and Baroque maturity, because from the Twelfth Dynasty these
elements interpenetrate in all harmony in the form-language of all the greater
works.</p>

<p class='c001'>The task before art-history is to write the <em>comparative biographies of the great
styles</em>, all of which as organisms of the same genus possess structurally cognate
life histories.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the beginning there is the timid, despondent, naked expression of a
newly-awakened soul which is still seeking for a relation between itself and
the world that, though its proper creation, yet is presented as alien and unfriendly.
There is the child’s fearfulness in Bishop Bernward’s building at
Hildesheim, in the Early-Christian catacomb-painting, and in the pillar-halls
of the Egyptian Fourth Dynasty. A February of art, a deep presentiment of
a coming wealth of forms, an immense suppressed tension, lies over the landscape
that, still wholly rustic, is adorning itself with the first strongholds and
townlets. Then follows the joyous mounting into the high Gothic, into the
Constantinian age with its pillared basilicas and its domical churches, into the
relief-ornament of the Fifth-Dynasty temple. <em>Being</em> is understood, a sacred
form-language has been completely mastered and radiates its glory, and the
Style ripens into a majestic symbolism of directional depth and of Destiny.
But fervent youth comes to an end, and contradictions arise within the soul
itself. The Renaissance, the Dionysiac-musical hostility to Apollinian Doric,
the Byzantine of 450 that looks to Alexandria and away from the overjoyed
art of Antioch, indicate a moment of resistance, of effective or ineffective
impulse to destroy what has been acquired. It is very difficult to elucidate
this moment, and an attempt to do so would be out of place here.</p>

<p class='c001'>And now it is the manhood of the style-history that comes on. The Culture
is changing into the intellectuality of the great cities that will now dominate
the country-side, and <span lang="la"><i>pari passu</i></span> the style is becoming intellectualized also.
The grand symbolism withers; the riot of superhuman forms dies down; milder
and more worldly arts drive out the great art of developed stone. Even in
Egypt sculpture and fresco are emboldened to lighter movement. The <em>artist</em>
appears, and “plans” what formerly grew out of the soil. Once more existence
becomes self-conscious and now, detached from the land and the dream and the
mystery, stands questioning, and wrestles for an expression of its new duty—as
at the beginning of Baroque when Michelangelo, in wild discontent and
kicking against the limitations of his art, piles up the dome of St. Peter’s—in
the age of Justinian I which built Hagia Sophia and the mosaic-decked domed
basilicas of Ravenna—at the beginning of that Twelfth Dynasty in Egypt
which the Greeks condensed under the name of Sesostris—and at the decisive
epoch in Hellas (c. 600) whose architecture probably, nay certainly, expressed
that which is echoed for us in its grandchild Æschylus.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Then comes the gleaming autumn of the style. Once more the soul depicts
its happiness, this time conscious of self-completion. The “return to Nature”
which already thinkers and poets—Rousseau, Gorgias and their “contemporaries”
in the other Cultures—begin to feel and to proclaim, reveals itself in
the form-world of the arts as a sensitive longing and <em>presentiment of the end</em>. A
perfectly clear intellect, joyous urbanity, the sorrow of a parting—these are
the colours of these last Culture-decades of which Talleyrand was to remark
later: <span lang="fr">“Qui n’a pas vécu avant 1789 ne connaît pas la douceur de vivre.”</span> So it
was, too, with the free, sunny and superfine art of Egypt under Sesostris III
(c. 1850 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>) and the brief moments of satiated happiness that produced
the varied splendour of Pericles’s Acropolis and the works of Zeuxis and
Phidias. A thousand years later again, in the age of the Ommaiyads, we
meet it in the glad fairyland of Moorish architecture with its fragile columns
and horseshoe arches that seem to melt into air in an iridescence of
arabesques and stalactites. A thousand years more, and we see it in the
music of Haydn and Mozart, in Dresden shepherdesses, in the pictures of Watteau
and Guardi, and the works of German master-builders at Dresden,
Potsdam, Würzburg and Vienna.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then the style fades out. The form-language of the Erechtheum and
the Dresden Zwinger, honeycombed with intellect, fragile, ready for self-destruction,
is followed by the flat and senile Classicism that we find in the
Hellenistic megalopolis, the Byzantium of 900 and the “Empire” modes of the
North. The end is a sunset reflected in forms revived for a moment by pedant
or by eclectic—semi-earnestness and doubtful genuineness dominate the world
of the arts. We to-day are in this condition—playing a tedious game with
dead forms to keep up the illusion of a living art.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>IX</h4>

<p class='c018'>No one has yet perceived that Arabian art is a single phenomenon. It is an
idea that can only take shape when we have ceased to be deceived by the crust
which overlaid the young East with post-Classical art-exercises that, whether
they were imitation-antique or chose their elements from proper or alien sources
at will, were in any case long past all inward life; when we have discovered
that Early Christian art, together with every really living element in “late-Roman,”
is in fact the springtime of the <em>Arabian style</em>; and when we see the
epoch of Justinian I as exactly on a par with the Spanish-Venetian Baroque that
ruled Europe in the great days of Charles V or Philip II, and the palaces of
Byzantium and their magnificent battle-pictures and pageant-scenes—the vanished
glories that inspired the pens of courtly literati like Procopius—on a par
with the palaces of early Baroque in Madrid, Vienna and Rome and the great
decorative-painting of Rubens and Tintoretto. This Arabian style embraces
the entire first millennium of our era. It thus stands at a critical position in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>the picture of a general history of “Art,” and its organic connectedness has
been imperceptible under the erroneous conventions thereof.<a id='r247'></a><a href='#f247' class='c019'><sup>[247]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Strange and—if these studies have given us the eye for things latent—moving
it is to see how this young Soul, held in bondage to the intellect of the
Classical and, above all, to the political omnipotence of Rome, dares not rouse
itself into freedom but humbly subjects itself to obsolete value-forms and tries
to be content with Greek language, Greek ideas and Greek art-elements. Devout
acceptance of the powers of the strong day is present in every young
Culture and is the sign of its youth—witness the humility of Gothic man in
his pious high-arched spaces with their pillar-statuary and their light-filled
pictures in glass, the high tension of the Egyptian soul in the midst of its
world of pyramids, lotus-columns and relief-lined halls. But in this instance
there is the additional element of an intellectual prostration before forms really
dead but supposedly eternal. Yet in spite of all, the taking-over and continuance
of these forms came to nothing. Involuntarily, unobserved, not supported
by an inherent pride as Gothic was, but felt, there in Roman Syria, almost as
a lamentable come-down, a whole new form-world grew up. Under a mask of
Græco-Roman conventions, it filled even Rome itself. The master-masons of
the Pantheon and the Imperial Fora were <em>Syrians</em>. In no other example is the
primitive force of a young soul so manifest as here, where it has to make its
own world by sheer conquest.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this as in every other Culture, Spring seeks to express its spirituality in
a new ornamentation and, above all, in religious architecture as the sublime
form of that ornamentation. But of all this rich form-world the only part
that (till recently) has been taken into account has been the Western edge of it,
which consequently has been assumed to be the true home and habitat of Magian
style-history. In reality, in matters of style as in those of religion, science
and social-political life, what we find there is only an irradiation from outside
the Eastern border of the Empire.<a id='r248'></a><a href='#f248' class='c019'><sup>[248]</sup></a> Riegl<a id='r249'></a><a href='#f249' class='c019'><sup>[249]</sup></a> and Strzygowski<a id='r250'></a><a href='#f250' class='c019'><sup>[250]</sup></a> have discovered
this, but if we are to go further and arrive at a conspectus of the development
of Arabian art we have to shed many philological and religious prepossessions.
The misfortune is that our art-research, although it no longer recognizes the
religious frontiers, nevertheless unconsciously assumes them. For there is in
reality no such thing as a Late-Classical nor an Early-Christian nor yet an
Islamic art in the sense of an art proper to each of those faiths and evolved by
the community of believers as such. On the contrary, the totality of these
religions—from Armenia to Southern Arabia and Axum, and from Persia to
Byzantium and Alexandria—possess a broad uniformity of artistic expression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>that overrides the contradictions of detail.<a id='r251'></a><a href='#f251' class='c019'><sup>[251]</sup></a> <em>All</em> these religions, the Christian,
the Jewish, the Persian, the Manichæan, the Syncretic,<a id='r252'></a><a href='#f252' class='c019'><sup>[252]</sup></a> possessed cult-buildings
and (at any rate in their script) an Ornamentation of the first rank; and however
different the items of their dogmas, they are all pervaded by an homogeneous
religiousness and express it in a homogeneous symbolism of depth-experience.
There is something in the basilicas of Christianity, Hellenistic, Hebrew and
Baal-cults, and in the Mithræum,<a id='r253'></a><a href='#f253' class='c019'><sup>[253]</sup></a> the Mazdaist fire-temple and the Mosque,
that tells of a like spirituality: it is the <em>Cavern</em>-feeling.</p>

<p class='c001'>It becomes therefore the bounden duty of research to seek to establish the
hitherto completely neglected architecture of the South-Arabian and Persian
temple, the Syrian and the Mesopotamian synagogue, the cult-buildings of
Eastern Asia Minor and even Abyssinia;<a id='r254'></a><a href='#f254' class='c019'><sup>[254]</sup></a> and in respect of Christianity to
investigate no longer merely the Pauline West but also the Nestorian East that
stretched from the Euphrates to China, where the old records significantly call
its buildings “Persian temples.” If in all this building practically nothing has,
so far, forced itself specially upon our notice, it is fair to suppose that both
the advance of Christianity first and that of Islam later could change the religion
of a place of worship without contradicting its plan and style. We know that
this is the case with Late Classical temples: but how many of the churches in
Armenia may once have been fire-temples?</p>

<p class='c001'>The artistic centre of this Culture was very definitely—as Strzygowski
has observed—in the triangle of cities Edessa, Nisibis, Amida. To the westward
of it is the domain of the Late-Classical “Pseudomorphosis,”<a id='r255'></a><a href='#f255' class='c019'><sup>[255]</sup></a> the
Pauline Christianity that conquered in the councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon,<a id='r256'></a><a href='#f256' class='c019'><sup>[256]</sup></a>
Western Judaism and the cults of Syncretism. <em>The architectural type of the Pseudomorphosis</em>,
both for Jew and Gentile, is the Basilica.<a id='r257'></a><a href='#f257' class='c019'><sup>[257]</sup></a> It employs the means of
the Classical to express the opposite thereof, and is unable to free itself from
these means—that is the essence and the tragedy of “Pseudomorphosis.”
The more “Classical” Syncretism modifies a cult that is resident in a Euclidean
place into one which is <em>professed by a community</em> of indefinite estate, the more the
interior of the temple gains in importance over the exterior without needing
to change either plan or roof or columns very much. The space-feeling is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>different, but not—at first—the means of expressing it. In the pagan religious
architecture of the Imperial Age there is a perceptible—though never
yet perceived—movement from the wholly corporeal Augustan temple, in
which the cella is the architectural expression of <em>nothingness</em>, to one in which
the interior <em>only</em> possesses meaning. Finally the external picture of the Peripteros
of the Doric is transferred to the four inside walls. Columns ranked in
front of a windowless wall are a denial of space beyond—that is, for the
Classical beholder, of space within, and for the Magian, of space without.
It is therefore a question of minor importance whether the entire space is
covered in as in the Basilica proper, or only the sanctuary as in the Sun-temple
of Baalbek with the great forecourt,<a id='r258'></a><a href='#f258' class='c019'><sup>[258]</sup></a> which later becomes a standing element of
the mosque and is probably of South Arabian origin.<a id='r259'></a><a href='#f259' class='c019'><sup>[259]</sup></a> That the Nave originates
in a court surrounded by halls is suggested not only by the special development
of the basilica-type in the East Syrian steppe (particularly Hauran) but also
by the basic disposition of porch, nave and choir as stages leading to the altar—for
the aisles (originally the side-halls of the court) end blind, and only the
nave proper corresponds with the apse. This basic meaning is very evident in
St. Paul at Rome, albeit the Pseudomorphosis (inversion of the Classical
temple) dictated the technical means, viz., column and architrave. How symbolic
is the Christian reconstruction of the Temple of Aphrodisias in Caria, in
which the cella within the columns is abolished and replaced by a new wall
outside them.<a id='r260'></a><a href='#f260' class='c019'><sup>[260]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Outside the domain of the “Pseudomorphosis,” on the contrary, the cavern-feeling
was free to develop its own form-language, and here therefore it is <em>the
definite roof that is emphasized</em> (whereas in the other domain the protest against
the Classical feeling led merely to the development of an <em>interior</em>). When and
where the various possibilities of dome, cupola, barrel-vaulting, rib-vaulting,
came into existence as technical methods is, as we have already said, a matter
of no significance. What is of decisive importance is the fact that about the
time of Christ’s birth and the rise of the new world-feeling, the new space-symbolism
must have begun to make use of these forms and to develop them
further in expressiveness. It will very likely come to be shown that the fire-temples
and synagogues of Mesopotamia (and possibly also the temples of
Athtar in Southern Arabia) were originally cupola-buildings.<a id='r261'></a><a href='#f261' class='c019'><sup>[261]</sup></a> Certainly the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>pagan marna-temple at Gaza was so, and long before Pauline Christianity took
possession of these forms under Constantine, builders of Eastern origin had
introduced them, as novelties to please the taste of the Megalopolitans, into
all parts of the Roman Empire. In Rome itself, Apollodorus of Damascus was
employed under Trajan for the vaulting of the temple of “Venus and Rome,”
and the domed chambers of the Baths of Caracalla and the so-called “Minerva
Medica” of Gallienus’s time were built by Syrians. But the masterpiece, <em>the
earliest of all Mosques</em>, is the Pantheon as rebuilt by Hadrian. Here, without
a doubt, the emperor was imitating, for the satisfaction of his own taste,
cult-buildings that he had seen in the East.<a id='r262'></a><a href='#f262' class='c019'><sup>[262]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The architecture of the central-dome, in which the Magian world-feeling
achieved its purest expression, extended beyond the limits of the Roman Empire.
For the Nestorian Christianity that extended from Armenia even into
China it was the only form, as it was also for the Manichæns and the Mazdaists,
and it also impressed itself victoriously upon the Basilica of the West
when the Pseudomorphosis began to crumble and the last cults of Syncretism
to die out. In Southern France—where there were Manichæan sects even as
late as the Crusades—the form of the East was domesticated. Under Justinian,
the interpenetration of the two produced the domical basilica of Byzantium
and Ravenna. The pure basilica was pushed into the Germanic West, there to
be transformed by the energy of the Faustian depth-impulse into the cathedral.
The domed basilica, again, spread from Byzantium and Armenia into Russia,
where it came by slow degrees to be felt as an element of exterior architecture
belonging to a symbolism concentrated in the roof. But in the Arabian world
Islam, the heir of Monophysite and Nestorian Christianity and of the Jews and
the Persians, carried the development through to the end. When it turned
Hagia Sophia into a mosque it only resumed possession of an old property.
Islamic domical building followed Mazdaist and Nestorian along the same
tracks to Shan-tung and to India. Mosques grew up in the far West in Spain
and Sicily, where, moreover, the style appears rather in its East-Aramæan-Persian
than in its West-Aramæan-Syrian mode.<a id='r263'></a><a href='#f263' class='c019'><sup>[263]</sup></a> And while Venice looked
to Byzantium and Ravenna (St. Mark), the brilliant age of the Norman-Hohenstaufen
rule in Palermo taught the cities of the Italian west coast, and
even Florence, to admire and to imitate these Moorish buildings. More than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>one of the motives that the Renaissance thought were Classical—e.g., the
court surrounded by halls and the union of column and arch—really originated
thus.</p>

<p class='c001'>What is true as regards architecture is even more so as regards ornamentation,
which in the Arabian world very early overcame all figure-representation
and swallowed it up in itself. Then, as “arabesque,” it advanced to meet, to
charm and to mislead the young art-intention of the West.</p>

<p class='c001'>The early-Christian-Late-Classical art of the Pseudomorphosis shows the
same ornament-<em>plus</em>-figure mixture of the inherited “alien” and the inborn
“proper” as does the Carolingian-Early Romanesque of (especially) Southern
France and Upper Italy. In the one case Hellenistic intermingles with Early-Magian,
in the other Mauro-Byzantine with Faustian. The researcher has to
examine line after line and ornament after ornament to detect the form-feeling
which differentiates the one stratum from the other. In every architrave, in
every frieze, there is to be found a secret battle between the conscious old and
the unconscious, but victorious, new motives. One is confounded by this
general interpenetration of the Late-Hellenistic and the Early-Arabian form-senses,
as one sees it, for example, in Roman portrait-busts (here it is often
only in the treatment of the hair that the new way of expression is manifested);
in the acanthus-shoots which show—often on one and the same frieze—chisel-work
and drill-work side by side; in the sarcophagi of the 3rd Century
in which a childlike feeling of the Giotto and Pisano character is entangled
with a certain late and megalopolitan Naturalism that reminds one more or
less of David or Carstens; and in buildings such as the Basilica of Maxentius<a id='r264'></a><a href='#f264' class='c019'><sup>[264]</sup></a>
and many parts of the Baths and the Imperial Fora that are still very Classical
in conception.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nevertheless, the Arabian soul was cheated of its maturity—like a young
tree that is hindered and stunted in its growth by a fallen old giant of the
forest. Here there was no <a id='corr212.30'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='brillant'>brilliant</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_212.30'>brilliant</a></span> instant <em>felt and experienced as such</em>, like that
of ours in which, simultaneously with the Crusades, the wooden beams of the
Cathedral roof locked themselves into rib-vaulting and an interior was made to
actualize and fulfil the idea of infinite space. The political creation of Diocletian
was shattered in its glory upon the fact that, standing as he did on Classical
ground, he had to accept the whole mass of the administrative tradition of
Urbs Roma; this sufficed to reduce his work to a mere reform of obsolete conditions.
And yet he was the first of the Caliphs. With him, the idea of the
Arabian State emerges clearly into the light. It is Diocletian’s dispensation,
together with that of the Sassanids which preceded it somewhat and served
in all respects as its model, that gives us the first notion of the ideal that ought
to have gone on to fulfilment here. But so it was in all things. To this very
day we admire as last creations of the Classical—because we cannot or will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>not regard them otherwise—the thought of Plotinus and Marcus Aurelius,
the cults of Isis, Mithras and the Sun-God, the Diophantine mathematics and,
lastly, the whole of the art which streamed towards us from the Eastern marches
of the Roman Empire and for which Antioch and Alexandria were merely
<i>points d’appui</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'>This alone is sufficient to explain the intense vehemence with which the
Arabian Culture, when released at length from artistic as from other fetters,
flung itself upon all the lands that had inwardly belonged to it for centuries
past. It is the sign of a soul that feels itself in a hurry, that notes in fear the
first symptoms of old age before it has had youth. This emancipation of Magian
mankind is without a parallel. Syria is conquered, or rather <em>delivered</em>, in 634.
Damascus falls in 637, Ctesiphon in 637. In 641 Egypt and India are reached,
in 647 Carthage, in 676 Samarkand, in 710 Spain. And in 732 the Arabs stood
before Paris. Into these few years was compressed the whole sum of saved-up
passions, postponed hopes, reserved deeds, that in the slow maturing of other
Cultures suffice to fill the history of centuries. The Crusaders before Jerusalem,
the Hohenstaufen in Sicily, the Hansa in the Baltic, the Teutonic Knights in
the Slavonic East, the Spaniards in America, the Portuguese in the East Indies,
the Empire of Charles V on which the sun never set, the beginnings of England’s
colonial power under Cromwell—the equivalent of all this was shot out in
<em>one</em> discharge that carried the Arabs to Spain and France, India and Turkestan.</p>

<p class='c001'>True, all Cultures (the Egyptian, the Mexican and the Chinese excepted)
have grown up under the tutelage of some older Culture. Each of the form-worlds
shows certain alien traits. Thus, the Faustian soul of the Gothic,
already predisposed to reverence by the Arabian origin of Christianity, grasped
at the treasures of Late-Arabian art. An unmistakably Southern, one might
even say an Arabian, Gothic wove itself over the façades of the Burgundian and
Provençal cathedrals, dominated with a magic of stone the outward language
of Strassburg Minster, and fought a silent battle in statues and porches, fabric-patterns,
carvings and metalwork—and not less in the intricate figures of scholastic
philosophy and in that intensely Western symbol, the Grail legend<a id='r265'></a><a href='#f265' class='c019'><sup>[265]</sup></a>—with
the Nordic prime-feeling of <em>Viking Gothic</em> that rules the interior of the
Magdeburg Cathedral, the points of Freiburg Minster and the mysticism of
Meister Eckart. More than once the pointed arch threatens to burst its restraining
line and to transform itself into the horseshoe arch of Moorish-Norman
architecture.</p>

<p class='c001'>So also the Apollinian art of the Doric spring—whose first efforts are
practically lost to us—doubtless took over Egyptian elements to a very large
extent, and by and through these came to its own proper symbolism.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>But the Magian soul of the Pseudomorphosis had not the courage to appropriate
alien means <em>without yielding to them</em>. And this is why the physiognomic
of the Magian soul has still so much to disclose to the quester.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>X</h4>

<p class='c018'>The idea of the Macrocosm, then, which presents itself in the style-problem
as simplified and capable of treatment, poses a multitude of tasks for the future
to tackle. To make the form-world of the arts available as a means of penetrating
the spirituality of entire Cultures—by handling it in a thoroughly
physiognomic and symbolic spirit—is an undertaking that has not hitherto
got beyond speculations of which the inadequacy is obvious. We are hardly
as yet aware that there may be a psychology of the metaphysical bases of all
great architectures. We have no idea what there is to discover in the change
of meaning that a form of <em>pure extension</em> undergoes when it is taken over into
another Culture. The history of the column has never yet been written, nor
have we any notion of the deeply symbolic significances that reside in the means
and the instruments of art.</p>

<p class='c001'>Consider mosaic. In Hellenic times it was made up of pieces of marble,
it was opaque and corporeal-Euclidean (e.g., the famous Battle of Issus at
Naples), and it adorned the floor. But with the awakening of the Arabian
soul it came to be built up of pieces of glass and set in fused gold, and it simply
covered the walls and roofs of the domed basilica. This Early-Arabian Mosaic-picturing
corresponds exactly, as to phase, with the glass-picturing of Gothic
cathedrals, both being “early” arts ancillary to religious architectures. The
one by letting in the light enlarges the church-space into world-space, while
the other transforms it into the magic, gold-shimmering sphere which bears
men away from earthly actuality into the visions of Plotinus, Origen, the
Manichæans, the Gnostics and the Fathers, and the Apocalyptic poems.</p>

<p class='c001'>Consider, again, the beautiful notion of <em>uniting the round arch and the column</em>;
this again is a Syrian, if not a North-Arabian, creation of the third (or “high
Gothic”) century.<a id='r266'></a><a href='#f266' class='c019'><sup>[266]</sup></a> The revolutionary importance of this motive, which is
specifically Magian, has never in the least degree been recognized; on the contrary,
it has always been assumed to be Classical, and for most of us indeed it
is even representatively Classical. The Egyptians ignored any deep relation
between the roof and the column; the latter was for them a plant-column, and
represented not stoutness but growth. Classical man, in his turn, for whom
the monolithic column was the mightiest symbol of Euclidean existence—all
body, all unity, all steadiness—connected it, in the strictest proportions of
vertical and horizontal, of strength and load, with his architrave. But here,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>in this union of arch and column which the Renaissance in its tragicomic
deludedness admired as expressly Classical (though it was a notion that the
Classical neither possessed nor could possess), the bodily principle of load and
inertia is rejected and the arch is made to spring clear and open out of the
slender column. The idea actualized here is at once a liberation from all earth-gravity
and a capture of space, and between this element and that of the dome
which soars free but yet encloses the great “cavern,” there is the deep relation
of like meaning. The one and the other are eminently and powerfully Magian,
and they come to their logical fulfilment in the “Rococo” stage of Moorish
mosques and castles, wherein ethereally delicate columns—often growing out
of, rather than based on, the ground—seem to be empowered by some secret
magic to carry a whole world of innumerable notched arcs, gleaming ornaments,
stalactites, and vaultings saturated with colours. The full importance of this
basic form of Arabian architecture may be expressed by saying that the combination
of column and architrave is the Classical, that of column and round
arch the Arabian, and that of pillar and pointed arch the Faustian Leitmotiv.</p>

<p class='c001'>Take, further, the history of the Acanthus motive.<a id='r267'></a><a href='#f267' class='c019'><sup>[267]</sup></a> In the form in which it
appears, for example, on the Monument of Lysicrates at Athens, it is one of
the most distinctive in Classical ornamentation. It has body, it is and remains
individual, and its structure is capable of being taken in at one glance. But
already it appears heavier and richer in the ornament of the Imperial Fora
(Nerva’s, Trajan’s) and that of the temple of Mars Ultor; the organic disposition
has become so complicated that, as a rule, it requires to be studied,
and the tendency to <em>fill up</em> the surfaces appears. In Byzantine art—of which
Riegl thirty years ago noticed the “latent Saracenic character” though he had
no suspicion of the connexion brought to light here—the acanthus leaf was
broken up into endless tendril-work which (as in Hagia Sophia) is disposed
quite inorganically over whole surfaces. To the Classical motive are added the
old-Aramæan vine and palm leaves, which have already played a part in Jewish
ornamentation. The interlaced borders of “Late-Roman” mosaic pavements
and sarcophagus-edges, and even geometrical plane-patterns are introduced,
and finally, throughout the Persian-Anatolian world, mobility and <span lang="fr"><i>bizarrerie</i></span>
culminate in the Arabesque. <em>This</em> is the genuine Magian motive—anti-plastic
to the last degree, hostile to the pictorial and to the bodily alike. Itself bodiless,
it disembodies the object over which its endless richness of web is drawn.
A masterpiece of this kind—a piece of architecture completely opened out
into Ornamentation—is the façade of the Castle of Mashetta in Moab built
by the Ghassanids.<a id='r268'></a><a href='#f268' class='c019'><sup>[268]</sup></a> The craft-art of Byzantine-Islamic style (hitherto called
Lombard, Frankish, Celtic or Old-Nordic) which invaded the whole youthful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>West and dominated the Carolingian Empire, was largely practised by Oriental
craftsmen or imported as patterns for our own weavers, metal-workers and
armourers.<a id='r269'></a><a href='#f269' class='c019'><sup>[269]</sup></a> Ravenna, Lucca, Venice, Granada, Palermo were the efficient
centres of this then highly-civilized form-language; in the year 1000, when
in the North the forms of a new Culture were already being developed and
established, Italy was still entirely dominated by it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Take, lastly, the changed point of view towards the human body. With
the victory of the Arabian world-feeling, men’s conception of it underwent a
complete revolution. In almost every Roman head of the period 100-250 that
the Vatican Collection contains, one may perceive the opposition of Apollinian
and Magian feeling, and of muscular position and “look” as different bases of
expression. Even in Rome itself, since Hadrian, the sculptor made constant
use of the drill, an instrument which was wholly repugnant to the Euclidean
feeling towards stone—for whereas the chisel brings out the limiting surfaces
and <span lang="la"><i>ipso facto</i></span> affirms the corporeal and material nature of the marble block, the
drill, in breaking the surfaces and creating effects of light and shade, denies it;
and accordingly the sculptors, be they Christian or “pagan,” lose the old
feeling for the phenomenon of the naked body. One has only to look at the
shallow and empty Antinous statues—and yet these were quite definitely
“Classical.” Here it is only the head that is physiognomically of interest—as
it never is in Attic sculpture. The drapery is given quite a new meaning,
and simply dominates the whole appearance. The consul-statues in the Capitoline
Museum<a id='r270'></a><a href='#f270' class='c019'><sup>[270]</sup></a> are conspicuous examples. The pupils are bored, and the eyes
look into the distance, so that the whole expression of the work lies no longer
in its body but in that Magian principle of the “Pneuma” which Neo-Platonism
and the decisions of the Church Councils, Mithraism and Mazdaism alike
presume in man.</p>

<p class='c001'>The pagan “Father” Iamblichus, about 300, wrote a book concerning
statues of gods in which the divine is substantially present and working upon
the beholder.<a id='r271'></a><a href='#f271' class='c019'><sup>[271]</sup></a> Against this idea of the image—an idea of the Pseudomorphosis—the
East and the South rose in a storm of iconoclasm; and the
sources of this iconoclasm lay in a conception of artistic creation that is nearly
impossible for us to understand.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>I <br> THE ARTS OF FORM</h3>

<h4 class='c021'>I</h4>

<p class='c018'>The clearest type of symbolic expression that the world-feeling of higher
mankind has found for itself is (if we except the mathematical-scientific domain
of presentation and the symbolism of its basic ideas) that of the arts of form,<a id='r272'></a><a href='#f272' class='c019'><sup>[272]</sup></a>
of which the number is legion. <em>And with these arts we count music</em> in its many
and very dissimilar kinds; had these been brought within the domain of art-historical
research instead of being put in a class apart from that of the pictorial-plastic
arts, we should have progressed very much further in our understanding
of the import of this evolution towards an end. For the formative impulse that
is at work in the <em>wordless</em><a id='r273'></a><a href='#f273' class='c019'><sup>[273]</sup></a> arts can never be understood until we come to regard
the distinction between optical and acoustic means as only a superficial one. To
talk of the art of the eye and the art of the ear takes us no further. It is not
such things that divide one art from another. Only the 19th Century could
so over-estimate the influence of <em>physiological</em> conditions as to apply it to
expression, conception or communion. A “singing” picture of Claude Lorrain
or of Watteau does not really address itself to the bodily eye any more than
the space-straining music since Bach addresses itself to the bodily ear. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Classical relation between art-work and sense-organ—of which we so often
and so erroneously remind ourselves here—is something quite different from,
something far simpler and more material than ours. We <em>read</em> “Othello” and
“Faust” and we study orchestral scores—that is, we change one sense-agency
for another in order to let the undiluted spirit of these works take effect upon
us. Here there is always an appeal from the outer senses to the “inner,” to
the truly Faustian and wholly un-Classical power of imagination. Only thus
can we understand Shakespeare’s ceaseless change of scene as against the Classical
unity of place. In extreme cases indeed, for instance in that of “Faust”
itself, no representation of the work (that is, of its full content) is physically
possible. But in music too—in the unaccompanied “A capella” of the Palestrina
style as well as <span lang="la"><i>a fortiori</i></span> in the Passions of Heinrich Schütz, in the fugues
of Bach, in the last quartets of Beethoven, and in “Tristan”—we livingly
experience <em>behind</em> the sensuous impressions a whole world of others. And it is
only through these latter that all the fullness and depth of the work begins to
be present to us, and it is only mediately—through the images of blond,
brown, dusky and golden colours, of sunsets and distant ranked mountain-summits,
of storms and spring landscapes, of foundered cities and strange faces
which harmony conjures up for us—that it tells us something of itself. It
is not an incident that Beethoven wrote his last works when he was deaf—deafness
merely released him from the last fetters. For this music, sight and
hearing <em>equally</em> are bridges into the soul and nothing more. To the Greek this
visionary kind of artistic enjoyment was utterly alien. He <em>felt</em> the marble
with his eye, and the thick tones of an aulos moved him almost <em>corporally</em>.
For him, eye and ear are the receivers of the <em>whole</em> of the impression that he
wished to receive. But for us this had ceased to be true even at the stage of
Gothic.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the actual, tones are something extended, limited and numerable just
as lines and colours are; harmony, melody, rhyme and rhythm no less so than
perspective, proportion, chiaroscuro and outline. The distance separating two
kinds of painting can be infinitely greater than that separating the painting
and the music of a period. Considered in relation to a statue of Myron, the
art of a Poussin landscape is the same as that of a contemporary chamber-cantata;
that of Rembrandt as that of the organ works of Buxtehude, Pachelbel
and Bach; that of Guardi as that of the Mozart opera—the <em>inner</em> form-language
is so nearly identical that the difference between optical and acoustic means
is negligible.</p>

<p class='c001'>The importance which the “science of art” has always attached to a timeless
and conceptual delimitation of the individual art-spheres only proves that
the fundamentals of the problem have not been attacked. Arts are living units,
and the living is incapable of being dissected. The first act of the learned
pedant has always been to partition the infinitely wide domain into provinces
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>determined by perfectly superficial criteria of medium and technique and to
endow these provinces with eternal validity and immutable (!) form-principles.
Thus he separated “Music” and “Painting,” “Music” and “Drama,” “Painting”
and “Sculpture.” And then he proceeded to define “the” art of Painting,
“the” art of Sculpture, and so on. But in fact the technical form-language is
no more than the <em>mask</em> of the real work. Style is not what the shallow Semper—worthy
contemporary of Darwin and materialism—supposed it to be, the
product of material, technique, and purpose. It is the very opposite of this,
something inaccessible to art-reason, a revelation of the metaphysical order,
a mysterious “must,” a Destiny. With the material boundaries of the different
arts it has no concern whatever.</p>

<p class='c001'>To classify the arts according to the character of the sense-impression, then,
is to pervert the problem of form in its very enunciation. For how is it possible
to predicate a genus “Sculpture” of so general a character as to admit of general
laws being evolved from it? What <em>is</em> “Sculpture?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Take painting again. There is no such thing as “<em>the</em>” art of Painting,
and anyone who compares a drawing of Raphael, effected by outline, with
one of Titian, effected by flecks of light and shade, without feeling that they
belong to two different arts; any one who does not realize a dissimilarity of
essence between the works of Giotto or Mantegna—relief, created by brushstroke—and
those of Vermeer or Goya—music, created on coloured canvas—such
a one will never grasp the deeper questions. As for the frescoes of Polygnotus
and the mosaics of Ravenna, there is not even the similarity of technical
means to bring them within the alleged genus, and what is there in common
between an etching and the art of Fra Angelico, or a proto-Corinthian vase-painting
and a Gothic cathedral-window, or the reliefs of Egypt and those of
the Parthenon?</p>

<p class='c001'>If an art has boundaries at all—boundaries of its soul-become-form—they
are historical and not technical or physiological boundaries.<a id='r274'></a><a href='#f274' class='c019'><sup>[274]</sup></a> An art is an
organism, not a system. There is no art-genus that runs through all the centuries
and all the Cultures. Even where (as in the case of the Renaissance)
supposed technical traditions momentarily deceive us into a belief in the eternal
validity of antique art-laws, there is at bottom entire discrepance. There is
<em>nothing</em> in Greek and Roman art that stands in any relation whatever to the
form-language of a Donatello statue or a painting of Signorelli or a façade of
Michelangelo. <em>Inwardly</em>, the Quattrocento is related to the contemporary
Gothic and to nothing else. The fact of the archaic Greek Apollo-type being
“influenced” by Egyptian portraiture, or early Tuscan representation by Etruscan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>tomb-painting, implies precisely what is implied by that of Bach’s writing
a fugue upon an alien theme—he shows what he can express with it. Every
individual art—Chinese landscape or Egyptian plastic or Gothic counterpoint—is
<em>once existent</em>, and departs with its soul and its symbolism never to return.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>II</h4>

<p class='c018'>With this, the notion of Form opens out immensely. Not only the technical
instrument, not only the form-language, but also <em>the choice of art-genus
itself</em> is seen to be an expression-means. What the creation of a masterpiece
means for an individual artist—the “Night Watch” for Rembrandt or the
“Meistersinger” for Wagner—that the creation of a <em>species</em> of art, comprehended
as such, means for the life-history of a Culture. It is epochal. Apart
from the merest externals, each such art is an individual organism without
predecessor or successor. Its theory, technique and convention all belong to
its character, and contain nothing of eternal or universal validity. When one
of these arts is born, when it is spent, whether it dies or is transmuted into
another, why this or that art is dominant in or absent from a particular Culture—all
these are questions of Form in the highest sense, just as is that other
question of why individual painters and musicians unconsciously avoid certain
shades and harmonies or, on the contrary, show preferences so marked that
authorship-attributions can be based on them.</p>

<p class='c001'>The importance of these groups of questions has not yet been recognized
by theory, even by that of the present day. And yet it is precisely from this
side, the side of their physiognomic, that the arts are accessible to the understanding.
Hitherto it has been supposed—without the slightest examination
of the weighty questions that the supposition involves—that the several
“arts” specified in the conventional classification-scheme (the validity of
which is assumed) are all <em>possible</em> at all times and places, and the absence of
one or another of them in particular cases is attributed to the accidental lack
of creative personalities or impelling circumstances or discriminating patrons
to guide “art” on its “way.” Here we have what I call a transference of the
causality-principle from the world of the become to that of the becoming.
Having no eye for the perfectly different logic and necessity of the Living, for
Destiny and the inevitableness and <em>unique occurrence</em> of its expression-possibilities,
men had recourse to tangible and obvious “causes” for the building of their
art-history, which thus came to consist of a series of events of only superficial
concordance.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have already, in the earliest pages of this work, exposed the shallowness
of the notion of a linear progression of “mankind” through the stages of
“ancient,” “mediæval” and “modern,” a notion that has made us blind to
the true history and structure of higher Cultures. The history of art is a conspicuous
case in point. Having assumed as self-evident the existence of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>number of constant and well-defined provinces of art, one proceeded to order
the history of these several provinces according to the—equally self-evident—scheme
of ancient-mediæval-modern, to the exclusion, of course, of Indian
and East-Asiatic art, of the art of Axum and Saba, of the Sassanids and of
Russia, which if not omitted altogether were at best relegated to appendices.
It occurred to no one that such results argued unsoundness in the method; the
scheme was there, demanded facts, and must at any price be fed with them.
And so a futile up-and-down course was stolidly traced out. Static times were
described as “natural pauses,” it was called “decline” when some great art
in reality died, and “renaissance” where an eye really free from prepossessions
would have seen another art being born in another landscape to express another
humanity. Even to-day we are still taught that the Renaissance was a rebirth
of the Classical. And the conclusion was drawn that it is possible and right
to take up arts that are found weak or even dead (in this respect the present
is a veritable battle-field) and set them going again by conscious reformation-program
or forced “revival.”</p>

<p class='c001'>And yet it is precisely in this problem of the end, the impressively sudden
end, of a great art—the end of the Attic drama in Euripides, of Florentine
sculpture with Michelangelo, of instrumental music in Liszt, Wagner and
Bruckner—that the organic character of these arts is most evident. If we
look closely enough we shall have no difficulty in convincing ourselves that
no <em>one</em> art of any greatness has ever been “reborn.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Of the Pyramid style <em>nothing</em> passed over into the Doric. <em>Nothing</em> connects
the Classical temple with the basilica of the Middle East, for the mere taking
over of the Classical column as a structural member, though to a superficial
observer it seems a fact of the first importance, weighs no more in reality than
Goethe’s employment of the old mythology in the “Classical Walpurgis
Night” scene of “Faust.” To believe genuinely in a rebirth of Classical art,
or any Classical art, in the Western 15th Century requires a rare stretch of the
imagination. And that a great art may die not merely with the Culture but
within it, we may see from the fate of music in the Classical world.<a id='r275'></a><a href='#f275' class='c019'><sup>[275]</sup></a> Possibilities
of great music there must have been in the Doric springtime—how otherwise
can we account for the importance of old-fashioned Sparta in the eyes of
such musicians as there were later (for Terpander, Thaletas and Alcman were
effective there when elsewhere the statuary art was merely infantile)?—and
yet the Late-Classical world refrained. In just the same fashion everything
that the Magian Culture had attempted in the way of frontal portraiture, deep
relief and mosaic finally succumbed before the Arabesque; and everything of the
plastic that had sprung up in the shade of Gothic cathedrals at Chartres, Reims,
Bamberg, Naumburg, in the Nürnberg of Peter Vischer and the Florence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>Verrocchio, vanished before the oil-painting of Venice and the instrumental
music of the Baroque.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>III</h4>

<p class='c018'>The temple of Poseidon at Pæstum and the Minster of Ulm, works of the
ripest Doric and the ripest Gothic, differ precisely as the Euclidean geometry
of bodily bounding-surfaces differs from the analytical geometry of the position
of points in space referred to spatial axes. All Classical building begins from
the outside, all Western from the inside. The Arabian also begins with the
inside, but it stays there. There is one and only one soul, the Faustian, that
craves for a style which drives through walls into the limitless universe of
space and makes both the exterior and the interior of the building complementary
images of one and the same world-feeling. The exterior of the basilica
and the domical building may be a <em>field for ornamentation</em>, but <em>architecture</em> it is
not. The impression that meets the beholder as he approaches is that of something
shielding, something that hides a secret. The form-language in the
cavern-twilight exists for the faithful only—that is the factor common to
the highest examples of the style and to the simplest Mithræa and Catacombs,
the prime powerful utterance of a new soul. Now, as soon as the Germanic
spirit takes possession of the basilical type, there begins a wondrous mutation
of all structural parts, as to both position and significance. Here in the Faustian
North the outer form of the building, be it cathedral or mere dwelling-house,
begins to be brought into relation with the meaning that governs the
arrangement of the interior, a meaning undisclosed in the mosque and non-existent
in the temple. The Faustian building has a <em>visage</em> and not merely a
façade (whereas the front of a peripteros is, after all, only one of four sides and
the centre-domed building in principle has not even a front) and with this
visage, this head, is associated an articulated trunk that draws itself out
through the broad plain like the cathedral at Speyer, or erects itself to the
heavens like the innumerable spires of the original design of Reims. The
<em>motive of the façade</em>, which greets the beholder and tells him the inner meaning
of the house, dominates not only individual major buildings but also the whole
aspect of our streets, squares and towns with their characteristic wealth of
windows.<a id='r276'></a><a href='#f276' class='c019'><sup>[276]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The great architecture of the early period is ever the mother of all following
arts; it determines the choice of them and the spirit of them. Accordingly, we
find that the history of the Classical shaping art is one untiring effort to accomplish
one single ideal, viz., the conquest of the free-standing human body
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>as the vessel of the pure real present. The temple of the naked body was to it
what the cathedral of voices was to the Faustian from earliest counterpoint
to the orchestral writing of the 18th Century. We have failed hitherto to
understand the emotional force of this secular tendency of the Apollinian,
because we have not felt how the <em>purely material, soulless body</em> (for the Temple
of the Body, too, has no "interior"!) is the object which archaic relief,
Corinthian painting on clay, and Attic fresco were all striving to obtain until
Polycletus and Phidias showed how to achieve it in full. We have, with a
wonderful blindness, assumed this kind of sculpture as both authoritative
and universally possible, as in fact, “the art of sculpture.” We have written
its history as one concerned with all peoples and periods, and even to-day
our sculptors, under the influence of unproved Renaissance doctrines, speak
of the naked human body as the noblest and most genuine object of “the”
art of sculpture. Yet in reality this statue-art, the art of the naked body
standing free upon its footing and appreciable from all sides alike, existed in
the Classical and the Classical only, for it was that Culture alone which
quite decisively refused to transcend sense-limits in favour of space. The
Egyptian statue is always meant to be seen from the front—it is a variant
of plane-relief. And the <em>seemingly</em> Classically-conceived statues of the Renaissance
(we are astounded, as soon as it occurs to us to count them, to find
how few of them there are<a id='r277'></a><a href='#f277' class='c019'><sup>[277]</sup></a>) are nothing but a semi-Gothic reminiscence.</p>

<p class='c001'>The evolution of this rigorously <em>non-spatial</em> art occupies the three centuries
from 650 to 350, a period extending from the completion of the Doric and the
simultaneous appearance of a tendency to free the figures from the Egyptian
limitation of frontalness<a id='r278'></a><a href='#f278' class='c019'><sup>[278]</sup></a> to the coming of the Hellenistic and its illusion-painting
which closed-off the grand style. This sculpture will never be rightly
appreciated until it is regarded as the last and highest Classical, as <em>springing
from a plane art, first obeying and then overcoming the fresco</em>. No doubt the technical
origin can be traced to experiments in figure-wise treatment of the pristine
column, or the plates that served to cover the temple wall,<a id='r279'></a><a href='#f279' class='c019'><sup>[279]</sup></a> and no doubt there
are here and there imitations of Egyptian works (seated figures of Miletus),
although very few Greek artists can ever have seen one.<a id='r280'></a><a href='#f280' class='c019'><sup>[280]</sup></a> But as a <em>form-ideal</em>
the statue goes back through relief to the archaic clay-painting in which
fresco also originated. Relief, like fresco, is tied to the bodily wall. All this
sculpture right down to Myron may be considered as relief detached from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>plane. In the end, the figure is treated as a self-contained body apart from the
mass of the building, but it remains essentially a silhouette in front of a wall.<a id='r281'></a><a href='#f281' class='c019'><sup>[281]</sup></a>
Direction in depth is excluded, and the work is spread out frontally before the
beholder. Even the Marsyas of Myron can be copied upon vases or coins without
much trouble or appreciable foreshortenings.<a id='r282'></a><a href='#f282' class='c019'><sup>[282]</sup></a> Consequently, of the two major
“late” arts after 650, fresco definitely has the priority. The small stock of
types is always to be found first in vase-figuring, which is often exactly paralleled
by quite late sculptures. We know that the Centaur group of the West
pediment at Olympia was worked out from a painting. On the Ægina temple,
the advance from the West to the East pediment is an advance from the fresco-character
to the body-character. The change is completed about 460 with
Polycletus, and thenceforward plastic groups become the model for strict painting.
But it is from Lysippus that the wholly cubic and “all-ways” treatment
becomes thoroughly veristic and yields “fact.” Till then, even in the case of
Praxiteles, we have still a lateral or planar development of the subject, with a
clear outline that is only fully effective in respect of one or two standpoints.
But an undeviating testimony to the picture-origin of independent sculpture is
the practice of polychroming the marble—a practice unknown to the Renaissance
and to Classicism, which would have felt it as barbaric<a id='r283'></a><a href='#f283' class='c019'><sup>[283]</sup></a>—and we may
say the same of the gold-and-ivory statuary and the enamel overlaying of
bronze, a metal which already possesses a shining golden tone of its own.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>IV</h4>

<p class='c018'>The corresponding stage of Western art occupies the three centuries 1500-1800,
between the end of late Gothic and the decay of Rococo which marks the
end of the great Faustian style. In this period, conformably to the persistent
growth into consciousness of the will to spatial transcendence, it is instrumental
music that develops into the ruling art. At the beginning, in the 17th Century,
music uses the characteristic tone-colours of the instruments, and the contrasts
of strings and wind, human voices and instrumental voices, as means wherewith
to <em>paint</em>. Its (quite unconscious) ambition is to parallel the great masters
from Titian to Velasquez and Rembrandt. It makes pictures (in the sonata
from Gabrieli [d. 1612.] to Corelli [d. 1713] every movement shows a theme
embellished with graces and set upon the background of a <span lang="la"><i>basso continuo</i></span>),
paints heroic landscapes (in the pastoral cantata), and draws a portrait in
lines of melody (in Monteverde’s “Lament of Ariadne,” 1608). With the
German masters, all this goes. Painting can take music no further. Music
becomes itself <em>absolute</em>: it is music that (quite unconsciously again) dominates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>both painting and architecture in the 18th Century. And, ever more and more
decisively, sculpture fades out from among the deeper possibilities of this
form-world.</p>

<p class='c001'>What distinguishes painting as it was before, from painting as it was after,
the shift from Florence to Venice—or, to put it more definitely, what separates
the painting of Raphael and that of Titian as two entirely distinct arts—is
that the plastic spirit of the one associates painting with relief, while the
musical spirit of the other works in a technique of visible brush-strokes and
atmospheric depth-effects that is akin to the chromatic of string and wind
choruses. It is an opposition and not a transition that we have before us, and
the recognition of the fact is vital to our understanding of the <em>organism</em> of these
arts. Here, if anywhere, we have to guard against the abstract hypothesis of
“eternal art-laws.” “Painting” is a mere word. Gothic glass-painting was
an element of Gothic architecture, the servant of its strict symbolism just as
the Egyptian and the Arabian and every other art in this stage was the servant
of the stone-language. Draped figures were built up as cathedrals were. Their
folds were an <em>ornamentation</em> of extreme sincerity and severe expressiveness. To
criticize their “stiffness” from a naturalistic-imitative point of view is to miss
the point entirely.</p>

<p class='c001'>Similarly “music” is a mere word. Some music there has been everywhere
and always, even <em>before</em> any genuine Culture, even among the beasts. But the
serious music of the Classical was nothing but a <em>plastic for the ear</em>. The tetrachords,
chromatic and enharmonic, have a structural and not a harmonic
meaning:<a id='r284'></a><a href='#f284' class='c019'><sup>[284]</sup></a> but this is the very difference between body and space. This music
was single-voiced. The few instruments that it employed were all developed
in respect of capacity for tone-plastic; and naturally therefore it rejected the
Egyptian harp, an instrument that was probably akin in tone-colour to the
<a id='corr227.28'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='harpischord'>harpsichord</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_227.28'>harpsichord</a></span>. But, above all, the melody—like Classical verse from Homer
to Hadrian’s time—was treated quantitatively and not accentually; that is,
the syllables, their bodies and their <em>extent</em>, decided the rhythm. The few fragments
that remain suffice to show us that the sensuous charm of this art is
something outside our comprehension; but this very fact should cause us also</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>to reconsider our ideas as to the impressions purposed and achieved by the
statuary and the fresco, for we do not and cannot experience the charm that
these exercised upon the Greek eye.</p>

<p class='c001'>Equally incomprehensible to us is Chinese music: in which, according to
educated Chinese, we are never able to distinguish gay from grave.<a id='r285'></a><a href='#f285' class='c019'><sup>[285]</sup></a> Vice
versa, to the Chinese all the music of the West without distinction is <em>march-music</em>.
Such is the impression that the rhythmic dynamic of our life makes upon
the accentless Tao of the Chinese soul, and, indeed, the impression that our
entire Culture makes upon an alien humanity—the directional energy of our
church-naves and our storeyed façades, the depth-perspectives of our pictures,
the march of our tragedy and narrative, not to mention our technics and the
whole course of our private and public life. We ourselves have <em>accent</em> in our
blood and therefore do not notice it. But when our rhythm is juxtaposed with
that of an alien life, we find the discordance intolerable.</p>

<p class='c001'>Arabian music, again, is quite another world. Hitherto we have only
observed it through the medium of the Pseudomorphosis, as represented by
Byzantine hymns and Jewish psalmody, and even these we know only in so
far as they have penetrated to the churches of the far West as antiphons, responsorial
psalmody and Ambrosian chants.<a id='r286'></a><a href='#f286' class='c019'><sup>[286]</sup></a> But it is self-evident that not
only the religious west of Edessa (the syncretic cults, especially Syrian sun-worship,
the Gnostic and the Mandæan) but also those to the east (Mazdaists,
Manichæans, Mithraists, the synagogues of Irak and in due course the Nestorian
Christians) must have possessed a sacred music of the same style; that side
by side with this a gay secular music developed (above all, amongst the South-Arabian
and Sassanid chivalry<a id='r287'></a><a href='#f287' class='c019'><sup>[287]</sup></a>); and that both found their culmination in the
Moorish style that reigned from Spain to Persia.</p>

<p class='c001'>Out of all this wealth, the Faustian soul borrowed only some few church-forms
and, moreover, in borrowing them, it instantly transformed them root
and branch (10th Century, Hucbald, Guido d’Arezzo). Melodic accent and
beat produced the “march,” and polyphony (like the rime of contemporary
poetry) the image of endless space. To understand this, we have to distinguish
between the imitative<a id='r288'></a><a href='#f288' class='c019'><sup>[288]</sup></a> and the ornamental sides of music, and although
owing to the fleeting nature of all tone-creations<a id='r289'></a><a href='#f289' class='c019'><sup>[289]</sup></a> our knowledge is limited to
the musical history of our own West, yet this is quite sufficient to reveal that
duality of development which is one of the master-keys of all art-history.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>The one is soul, landscape, feeling, the other strict form, style, school. West
Europe has an <em>ornamental music of the grand style</em> (corresponding to the full
plastic of the Classical) which is associated with the architectural history of
the cathedral, which is closely akin to Scholasticism and Mysticism, and which
finds its laws in the motherland of high Gothic between Seine and Scheldt.
Counterpoint developed simultaneously with the flying-buttress system, and
its source was the “Romanesque” style of the Fauxbourdon and the Discant
with their simple parallel and contrary motion.<a id='r290'></a><a href='#f290' class='c019'><sup>[290]</sup></a> It is an architecture of human
voices and, like the statuary-group and the glass-paintings, is only conceivable
in the setting of these stone vaultings. With them it is a high art of space, of
that space to which Nicolas of Oresme, Bishop of Lisieux, gave mathematical
meaning by the introduction of co-ordinates.<a id='r291'></a><a href='#f291' class='c019'><sup>[291]</sup></a> <em>This</em> is the genuine “rinascita”
and “reformatio” as Joachim of Floris saw it at the end of the 12th Century<a id='r292'></a><a href='#f292' class='c019'><sup>[292]</sup></a>—the
birth of a new soul mirrored in the form-language of a new art.</p>

<p class='c001'>Along with this there came into being in castle and village a secular <em>imitative</em>
music, that of troubadours, Minnesänger and minstrels. As <span lang="la">“ars nova”</span>
this travelled from the courts of Provence to the palaces of Tuscan patricians
about 1300, the time of Dante and Petrarch. It consisted of simple melodies
that appealed to the heart with their major and minor, of canzoni, madrigals
and caccias, and it included also a type of <span lang="fr"><i>galante</i></span> operetta (Adam de la Hale’s
“Robin and Marion”). After 1400, these forms give rise to forms of collective
singing—the rondeau and the ballade. All this is “art” for a public.<a id='r293'></a><a href='#f293' class='c019'><sup>[293]</sup></a>
Scenes are painted from life, scenes of love, hunting, chivalry. The point
of it is in the melodic inventiveness, instead of in the symbolism of its linear
progress.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus, musically as otherwise, the castle and the cathedral are distinct. The
cathedral <em>is</em> music and the castle <em>makes</em> music. The one begins with theory, the
other with impromptu: it is the distinction between waking consciousness
and living existence, between the spiritual and the knightly singer. Imitation
stands nearest to life and direction and therefore begins with melody, while
the symbolism of counterpoint belongs to extension and through polyphony
signifies infinite space. The result was, on the one side, a store of “eternal”
rules and, on the other, an inexhaustible fund of folk-melodies on which even
the 18th Century was still drawing. The same contrast reveals itself, artistically,
in the <em>class</em>-opposition of Renaissance and Reformation.<a id='r294'></a><a href='#f294' class='c019'><sup>[294]</sup></a> The courtly
taste of Florence was antipathetic to the spirit of counterpoint; the evolution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>of strict musical form from the Motet to the four-voice Mass through Dunstaple,
Binchois and Dufay (c. 1430) proceeded wholly within the magic circle
of Gothic architecture. From Fra Angelico to Michelangelo the great Netherlanders
ruled alone in ornamental music. Lorenzo de’ Medici found no one in
Florence who understood the strict style, and had to send for Dufay. And while
in this region Leonardo and Raphael were painting, in the north Okeghem
(d. 1495) and his school and Josquin des Prés (d. 1521) brought the formal
polyphony of human voices to the height of fulfilment.</p>

<p class='c001'>The transition into the “Late” age was heralded in Rome and Venice.
With Baroque the leadership in music passes to Italy. But at the same time
architecture ceases to be the ruling art and there is formed a group of Faustian
special-arts in which oil-painting occupies the central place. About 1560 the
empire of the human voice comes to an end in the <span lang="la"><i>a cappella</i></span> style of Palestrina
and Orlando Lasso (both d. 1594). Its powers could no longer express
the passionate drive into the infinite, and it made way for the chorus of instruments,
wind and string. And thereupon Venice produced Titian-music,
the new madrigal that in its flow and ebb follows the sense of the text. The
music of the Gothic is architectural and vocal, that of the Baroque pictorial
and instrumental. The one builds, the other operates by means of motives.
For all the arts have become urban and therefore secular. We pass from super-personal
Form to the personal expression of the Master, and shortly before
1600 Italy produces the <span lang="la"><i>basso continuo</i></span> which requires virtuosi and not pious
participants.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thenceforward, the great task was to extend the tone-corpus into the
infinity, or rather to <em>resolve it into an infinite space of tone</em>. Gothic had developed
the instruments into families of definite timbre. But the new-born “orchestra”
no longer observes limitations imposed by the human voice, but treats it as a
voice to be combined with other voices—at the same moment as our mathematic
proceeds from the geometrical analysis of Fermat to the purely functional
analysis of Descartes.<a id='r295'></a><a href='#f295' class='c019'><sup>[295]</sup></a> In Zarlino’s “Harmony” (1558) appears a genuine
perspective of pure tonal space. We begin to distinguish between ornamental
and fundamental instruments. Melody and embellishment join to produce the
Motive, and this in development leads to the rebirth of counterpoint in the
form of the fugal style, of which Frescobaldi was the first master and Bach
the culmination. To the vocal masses and motets the Baroque opposes its
grand, orchestrally-conceived forms of the oratorio (Carissimi), the cantata
(Viadana) and the opera (Monteverde). Whether a bass melody be set
against upper voices, or upper voices be concerted against one another upon
a background of <span lang="la"><i>basso continuo</i></span>, always sound-worlds of characteristic expression-quality
work reciprocally upon one another in the infinity of tonal space,
supporting, intensifying, raising, illuminating, threatening, overshadowing—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>music all of interplay, scarcely intelligible save through ideas of contemporary
Analysis.</p>

<p class='c001'>From out of these forms of the early Baroque there proceeded, in the 17th
Century, the sonata-like forms of suite, symphony and concerto grosso. The
inner structure and the sequence of movements, the thematic working-out and
modulation became more and more firmly established. And thus was reached
the great, immensely dynamic, form in which music—now completely bodiless—was
raised by Corelli and Handel and Bach to be the ruling art of the West.
When Newton and Leibniz, about 1670, discovered the Infinitesimal Calculus,
the fugal style was fulfilled. And when, about 1740, Euler began the definitive
formulation of functional Analysis, Stamitz and his generation were discovering
the last and ripest form of musical ornamentation, the four-part movement<a id='r296'></a><a href='#f296' class='c019'><sup>[296]</sup></a>
as vehicle of pure and unlimited motion. For, at that time, there was still
this one step to be taken. The theme of the fugue “is,” that of the new sonata-movement
“becomes,” and the issue of its working out is in the one case a
picture, in the other a drama. Instead of a series of pictures we get a cyclic
succession,<a id='r297'></a><a href='#f297' class='c019'><sup>[297]</sup></a> and the real source of this tone-language was in the possibilities,
realized at last, of our deepest and most intimate kind of music—the music of
the strings. Certain it is that the violin is the noblest of all instruments that
the Faustian soul has imagined and trained for the expression of its last secrets,
and certain it is, too, that it is in string quartets and violin sonatas that it has
experienced its most transcendent and most holy moments of full illumination.
Here, <em>in chamber-music, Western art as a whole reaches its highest point</em>. Here our
prime symbol of endless space is expressed as completely as the Spearman of
Polycletus expresses that of intense bodiliness. When one of those ineffably
yearning violin-melodies wanders through the spaces expanded around it by
the orchestration of Tartini or Nardini, Haydn, Mozart or Beethoven, we know
ourselves in the presence of an art beside which that of the Acropolis is alone
worthy to be set.</p>

<p class='c001'>With this, the Faustian music becomes dominant among the Faustian arts.
It banishes the plastic of the statue and tolerates only the minor art—an entirely
musical, refined, un-Classical and counter-Renaissance art—of porcelain, which
(as a discovery of the West) is contemporary with the rise of chamber-music to
full effectiveness. Whereas the statuary of Gothic is through-and-through
architectural ornamentation, human espalier-work, that of the Rococo remarkably
exemplifies the pseudo-plastic that results from entire subjection to
the form-language of music, and shows to what a degree the technique governing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>the presented foreground can be in contradiction with the real expression-language
that is hidden behind it. Compare Coysevox’s<a id='r298'></a><a href='#f298' class='c019'><sup>[298]</sup></a> (1686) crouching
Venus in the Louvre with its Classical prototype in the Vatican—in the one
plastic is understudying music, in the other plastic is itself. Terms like “staccato,”
“accelerando,” “andante” and “allegro” best describe the kind of
movements that we have here, the flow of the lines, the fluidity in the being of
the stone itself which like the porcelain has more or less lost its fine compactness.
Hence our feeling that the granular marble is out of keeping. Hence, too,
the wholly un-Classical tendency to work with reference to effects of light and
shade. This is quite in conformity with the principles of oil-painting from
Titian onwards. That which in the 18th Century is called “colour” in an etching,
a drawing, or a sculpture-group really signifies music. Music dominates
the painting of Watteau and Fragonard and the art of Gobelins and pastels,
and since then, have we not acquired the habit of speaking of colour-tones or
tone-colours? And do not the very words imply a recognition of a final <em>homogeneity</em>
between the two arts, superficially dissimilar as they are? And are not
these same words perfectly meaningless as applied to <em>any and every</em> Classical
art? But music did not stop there; it transmuted also the architecture of Bernini’s
Baroque into accord with its own spirit, and made of it Rococo, a style
of transcendent ornamentation upon which lights (or rather “tones”) play
to dissolve ceilings, walls and everything else constructional and actual into
polyphonies and harmonies, with architectural trills and cadences and runs to
complete the identification of the form-language of these halls and galleries
with that of the music imagined for them. Dresden and Vienna are the homes
of this late and soon-extinguished fairyland of <em>visible</em> chamber music, of
curved furniture and mirror-halls, and shepherdesses in verse and porcelain.
It is the final brilliant autumn with which the Western soul completes the
expression of its high style. And in the Vienna of the Congress-time it faded
and died.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>V</h4>

<p class='c018'>The Art of the Renaissance, considered from this particular one of its many
aspects,<a id='r299'></a><a href='#f299' class='c019'><sup>[299]</sup></a> is a <em>revolt against the spirit of the Faustian forest-music</em> of counterpoint,
which at that time was preparing to vassalize the whole form-language of the
Western Culture. It was the logical consequence of the open assertion of this
will in matured Gothic. It never disavowed its origin and it maintained the
character of a simple <em>counter-movement</em>; necessarily therefore it remained dependent
upon the forms of the original movement, and represented simply the
effect of these upon a hesitant soul. Hence, it was without true depth, either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>ideal or phenomenal. As to the first, we have only to think of the bursting
passion with which the Gothic world-feeling discharged itself upon the whole
Western landscape, and we shall see at once what sort of a movement it was
that the handful of select spirits—scholars, artists and humanists—initiated
about 1420.<a id='r300'></a><a href='#f300' class='c019'><sup>[300]</sup></a> In the first the issue was one of life and death for a new-born
soul, in the second it was a point of—taste. The Gothic gripped life in its
entirety, penetrated its most hidden corners. It created new men and a new
world. From the idea of Catholicism to the state-theory of the Holy Roman
Emperors, from the knightly tourney to the new city-form, from cathedral
to cottage, from language-building to the village maiden’s bridal attire, from
oil-painting to the Spielmann’s song, everything is hall-marked with the stamp
of one and the same symbolism. But the Renaissance, when it had mastered
some arts of word and picture, had shot its bolt. It altered the ways of thought
and the life-feeling of West Europe not one whit. It could penetrate as far as
costume and gesture, but the roots of life it could not touch—even in Italy
the world-outlook of the Baroque is essentially a continuation of the Gothic.<a id='r301'></a><a href='#f301' class='c019'><sup>[301]</sup></a>
It produced no wholly great personality between Dante and Michelangelo,
each of whom had one foot outside its limits. And as for the other—phenomenal
or manifested depth—the Renaissance never touched the people, even
in Florence itself. The man for whom they had ears was Savonarola—a phenomenon
of quite another spiritual order and one which begins to be comprehensible
when we discern the fact that, all the time, the deep under-currents
are steadily flowing on towards the Gothic-musical Baroque. The Renaissance
as an anti-Gothic movement and a reaction against the spirit of polyphonic
music has its Classical equivalent in the Dionysiac movement. This was a reaction
against Doric and against the sculptural-Apollinian world-feeling. It
did <em>not</em> “originate” in the Thracian Dionysus-cult, but merely took this up as
a weapon against and counter-symbol to the Olympian religion, precisely as in
Florence the cult of the antique was called in for the justification and confirmation
of a feeling already there. The period of the great protest was the 7th
Century in Greece and (<em>therefore</em>) the 15th in West Europe. In both cases we have
in reality an outbreak of deep-seated discordances in the Culture, which physiognomically
dominates a whole epoch of its history and especially of its artistic
world—in other words, a stand that the soul attempts to make against the
Destiny that at last it comprehends. The inwardly recalcitrant forces—<i>Faust’s
second Soul that would separate itself from the other</i>—are striving to deflect the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>sense of the Culture, to repudiate, to get rid of or to evade its inexorable necessity;
it stands anxious in presence of the call to accomplish its historical fate
in Ionic and Baroque. This anxiety fastened itself in Greece to the Dionysus-cult
with its musical, dematerializing, body-squandering orgasm, and in the
Renaissance to the tradition of the Antique and its cult of the bodily-plastic
tradition. In each case, the alien expression-means was brought in consciously
and deliberately, in order that the force of a directly-opposite form-language
should provide the suppressed feelings with a weight and a pathos of their
own, and so enable them to stand against the stream—in Greece the stream
which flowed from Homer and the Geometrical to Phidias, in the West
that which flowed from the Gothic cathedrals, through Rembrandt, to
Beethoven.</p>

<p class='c001'>It follows from the very character of a counter-movement that it is far easier
for it to define what it is opposing than what it is aiming at. This is the difficulty
of all Renaissance research. In the Gothic (and the Doric) it is just the
opposite—men are contending <em>for</em> something, not against it—but Renaissance
art is nothing more nor less than anti-Gothic art. Renaissance music,
too, is a contradiction in itself; the music of the Medicean court was the
Southern French <span lang="la">“ars nova,”</span> that of the Florentine Duomo was the Low-German
counterpoint, both alike essentially <em>Gothic</em> and the property of the
<em>whole</em> West.</p>

<p class='c001'>The view that is customarily taken of the Renaissance is a very clear instance
of how readily the proclaimed intentions of a movement may be mistaken for
its deeper meaning. Since Burckhardt,<a id='r302'></a><a href='#f302' class='c019'><sup>[302]</sup></a> criticism has controverted every <em>individual</em>
proposition that the leading spirits of the age put forward as to their
own tendencies—and yet, this done, it has continued to use the word Renaissance
substantially in the former sense. Certainly, one is conscious at once in
passing to the south of the Alps of a marked dissimilarity in architecture in
particular and in the look of the arts in general. But the very obviousness of
the conclusion that the impression prompts should have led us to distrust it
and to ask ourselves, instead, whether the supposed distinction of Gothic and
“antique” was not in reality merely a difference between <em>Northern and Southern</em>
aspects of one and the same form-world. Plenty of things in Spain give the
impression of being “Classical” merely because they are Southern, and if a
layman were confronted with the great cloister of S. Maria Novella or the façade
of the Palazzo Strozzi in Florence and asked to say if these were “Gothic” he
would certainly guess wrong. Otherwise, the sharp change of spirit ought to
have set in not beyond the Alps but only beyond the Apennines, for Tuscany
is artistically an island in Italian Italy. Upper Italy belongs entirely to a
Byzantine-tinted Gothic; Siena in particular is a genuine monument of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span><em>counter-Renaissance</em>, and Rome is already the home of Baroque. But, in fact, it
is the change of <em>landscape</em> that coincides with the change of feeling.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the actual birth of the Gothic style Italy had indeed no inward share.
At the epoch of 1000 the country was still absolutely under the domination of
Byzantine taste in the East and Moorish taste in the South. When Gothic
first took root here it was the mature Gothic, and it implanted itself with an
intensity and force for which we look in vain in any of the great Renaissance
creations—think of the “Stabat Mater,” the “Dies Iræ,” Catharine of Siena,
Giotto and Simone Martini! At the same time, it was lighted from the South
and its strangeness was, as it were, softened in acclimatization. That which
it suppressed or expelled was not, as has been supposed, some lingering strains
of the Classical but purely the Byzantine-<i>cum</i>-Saracen form-language that appealed
to the senses in familiar everyday life—in the buildings of Ravenna
and Venice but even more in the ornament of the fabrics, vessels and arms
imported from the East.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the Renaissance had been a “renewal” (whatever that may mean) of
the Classical <em>world-feeling</em>, then, surely, would it not have had to replace the
symbol of embraced and rhythmically-ordered <em>space</em> by that of closed structural
<em>body</em>? But there was never any question of this. On the contrary, the Renaissance
practised wholly and exclusively an architecture of space prescribed for
it by Gothic, from which it differed <em>only</em> in that in lieu of the Northern <span lang="de">“Sturm
und Drang”</span> it breathed the clear equable calm of the sunny, care-free and unquestioning
South. It produced <em>no</em> new building-idea, and the extent of its
architectural achievement might almost be reduced to <em>façades and courtyards</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, this focussing of expressible effort upon the street-front of a house or
the side of a cloister—many-windowed and ever significant of the spirit within—is
characteristic of the Gothic (and deeply akin to its art of portraiture);
and the cloistered courtyard itself is, from the Sun-temple of Baalbek to the
Court of the Lions in the Alhambra, as genuinely Arabian. And in the midst
of this art the Poseidon temple of Pæstum, all body, stands lonely and unrelated:
no one saw it, no one attempted to copy it. Equally un-Attic is the
Florentine sculpture, for Attic is <em>free</em> plastic, “in the round” in the full sense of
the words, whereas every Florentine statue feels behind it the ghost of the niche
into which the Gothic sculptor had built its real ancestors. In the relation of
figure to background and in the build of the body, the masters of the “Kings’
heads” at Chartres and the masters of the “George” choir at Bamberg exhibit
the same interpenetration of “Antique” and Gothic expression-means that we
have, neither intensified nor contradicted, in the manner of Giovanni Pisano
and Ghiberti and even Verrocchio.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we take away from the models of the Renaissance all elements that
originated later than the Roman Imperial Age—that is to say, those belonging
to the Magian form-world—nothing is left. Even from Late-Roman architecture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>itself all elements derived from the great days of Hellas had one by one
vanished. Most conclusive of all, though, is that motive which actually
<em>dominates</em> the Renaissance, which because of its Southern-ness we regard as the
noblest of the Renaissance characters, viz., <em>the association of round-arch and
column</em>. This association, no doubt, is very un-Gothic, but in the Classical
style it simply does not exist, and in fact it represents the leitmotif of the
Magian architecture that originated in Syria.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it was just then that the South received from the North those decisive
impulses which helped it first of all to emancipate itself entirely from Byzantium
and then to step from Gothic into Baroque. In the region comprised between
Amsterdam, Köln and Paris<a id='r303'></a><a href='#f303' class='c019'><sup>[303]</sup></a>—the counter-pole to Tuscany in the style-history
of our culture—counterpoint and oil-painting had been created in
association with the Gothic architecture. Thence Dufay in 1428 and Willaert
in 1516 came to the Papal Chapel, and in 1527 the latter founded that Venetian
school which was decisive of Baroque music. The successor of Willaert was
de Rore of Antwerp. A Florentine commissioned Hugo van der Goes to execute
the Portinari altar for Santa Maria Nuova, and Memlinc to paint a Last
Judgment. And over and above this, numerous pictures (especially Low-Countries
portraits) were acquired and exercised an enormous influence. In
1450 Rogier van der Weyden himself came to Florence, where his art was both
admired and imitated. In 1470 Justus van Gent introduced oil-painting to
Umbria, and Antonello da Messina brought what he had learned in the Netherlands
to Venice. How much “Dutch” and how little “Classical” there is
in the pictures of Filippino Lippi, Ghirlandaio and Botticelli and especially
in the engravings of Pollaiulo! Or in Leonardo himself. Even to-day critics
hardly care to admit the full extent of the influence exercised by the Gothic
North upon the architecture, music, painting and plastic of the Renaissance.<a id='r304'></a><a href='#f304' class='c019'><sup>[304]</sup></a>
It was just then, too, that Nicolaus Cusanus, Cardinal and Bishop of Brixen
(1401-1464), brought into mathematics the “infinitesimal” principle, that
<em>contrapuntal method</em> of number which he reached by deduction from the idea of
God as Infinite Being. It was from Nicholas of Cusa that Leibniz received the
decisive impulse that led him to work out his differential calculus; and thus
was forged the weapon with which dynamic, Baroque, Newtonian, physics
definitely overcame the static idea characteristic of the Southern physics that
reaches a hand to Archimedes and is still effective even in Galileo.</p>

<p class='c001'>The high period of the Renaissance is a moment of <em>apparent</em> expulsion of
music from Faustian art. And in fact, for a few decades, in the only area where
Classical and Western landscapes touched, Florence did uphold—with one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>grand effort that was essentially metaphysical and essentially defensive—an
image of the Classical so convincing that, although its deeper characters were
without exception mere anti-Gothic, it lasted beyond Goethe and, if not for
our criticism, yet for our feelings, is valid to this day. The Florence of Lorenzo
de’ Medici and the Rome of Leo the Tenth—that is what for us the Classical
<em>is</em>, an eternal goal of most secret longing, the only deliverance from our heavy
hearts and limit upon our horizon. And it is this because, and only because,
it is anti-Gothic. So clean-cut is the opposition of Apollinian and Faustian
spirituality.</p>

<p class='c001'>But let there be no mistake as to the extent of this illusion. In Florence men
practiced fresco and relief in contradiction of Gothic glass-painting and Byzantine
gold-ground mosaic. This was the one moment in the history of the West
when sculpture ranked as the paramount art. The dominant elements in the
picture are the poised bodies, the ordered groups, the structural side of architecture.
The backgrounds possess no intrinsic value, merely serving to fill up
between and behind the self-sufficient present of the foreground-figures. For
a while here, painting is actually under the domination of plastic; Verrocchio,
Pollaiuolo and Botticelli were goldsmiths. Yet, all the same, these frescoes
have nothing of the spirit of Polygnotus in them. Examine a collection of
Classical painted vases—not in individual specimens or copies (which would
give the wrong idea) but in the mass, for this is the one species of Classical art
in which originals are plentiful enough to impress us effectively with the <em>will</em>
that is behind the art. In the light of such a study, the utter un-Classicalness
of the Renaissance-spirit leaps to the eye. The great achievement of Giotto and
Masaccio in creating a fresco-art is only <em>apparently</em> a revival of the Apollinian
way of feeling; but the depth-experience and idea of extension that underlies
it is not the Apollinian unspatial and self-contained body but the <em>Gothic field</em>
(Bildraum). However recessive the backgrounds are, they exist. Yet here
again there was the fullness of light, the clarity of atmosphere, the great
noon-calm, of the South; dynamic space was changed in Tuscany, and only in
Tuscany, to the static space of which Piero della Francesca was the master.
Though fields of space were painted, they were put, not as an existence unbounded
and like music ever striving into the depths, but as <em>sensuously definable</em>.
Space was given a sort of bodiliness and order in plane layers, and drawing,
sharpness of outline, definition of surface were studied with a care that seemingly
approached the Hellenic ideal. Yet there was always this difference,
that Florence depicted space perspectively as singular in contrast with things
as plural, whereas Athens presented things as separate singulars in contrast
to general nothingness. And in proportion as the surge of the Renaissance
smoothed down, the <em>hardness</em> of this tendency receded, from Masaccio’s frescoes
in the Brancacci Chapel to Raphael’s in the Vatican Stanze, until the <span lang="it"><i>sfumato</i></span>
of Leonardo, the melting of the edges into the background, brings a musical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>ideal in place of the relief-ideal into painting. The hidden dynamic is equally
unmistakable in the sculpture of Florence—it would be perfectly hopeless to
look for an Attic companion for Verrocchio’s equestrian statue.<a id='r305'></a><a href='#f305' class='c019'><sup>[305]</sup></a> This art was
a <em>mask</em>, a mode of the taste of an élite, and sometimes a comedy—though
never was comedy more gallantly played out. The indescribable inward purity
of Gothic form often causes us to forget what an excess of native strength and
depth it possessed. Gothic, it must be repeated again, is the <em>only</em> foundation of
the Renaissance. The Renaissance never even touched the real Classical, let
alone understood it or “revived” it. The consciousness of the Florentine
élite, wholly under literary influences, fashioned the deceptive name to positivize
the negative element of the movement—thereby demonstrating how
little such currents are aware of their own nature. There is not a single one
of their great works that the contemporaries of Pericles, or even those of Cæsar,
would not have rejected as utterly alien. Their palace courtyards are Moorish
courtyards, and their round arches on slender pillars are of Syrian origin.
Cimabue taught his century to imitate with the brush the art of Byzantine
mosaic. Of the two famous domical buildings of the Renaissance, the domed
cathedral of Florence is a masterpiece of late Gothic, and St. Peter’s is one of
early Baroque. When Michelangelo set himself to build the latter as the
“Pantheon towering over the Basilica of Maxentius,” he was naming two
buildings of the purest early Arabian style. And ornament—is there indeed
a genuine Renaissance ornamentation? Certainly there is nothing comparable
in symbolic force with the ornamentation of Gothic. But what is the provenance
of that gay and elegant embellishment which has a real inward unity
of its own and has captivated all Europe? There is a great difference between the
home of a “taste” and the home of the expression-means that it employs: one
finds a great deal that is Northern in the early Florentine motives of Pisano,
Maiano, Ghiberti and Della Quercia. We have to distinguish in all these
chancels, tombs, niches and porches between the outward and transferable
forms (the Ionic column itself is doubly a transfer, for it originated in Egypt)
and the spirit of the form-language that uses them as means and signs. One
Classical element or item is equivalent to another so long as something un-Classical
is being expressed—significance lies not in the thing but in the way
in which it is used. But even in Donatello such motives are far fewer than in
mature Baroque. As for a strict Classical capital, no such thing is to be found.</p>

<p class='c001'>And yet, at moments, Renaissance art succeeded in achieving something
wonderful that music <em>could not</em> reproduce—a feeling for the bliss of perfect
<em>nearness</em>, for pure, restful and <em>liberating</em> space-effects, bright and tidy and free
from the passionate movement of Gothic and Baroque. It is not Classical,
but it is a dream of Classical existence, the only dream of the Faustian soul in
which it was able to forget itself.</p>

<p class='c018'>And now, with the 16th Century, the decisive epochal turn begins for Western
painting. The trusteeship of architecture in the North and that of sculpture
in Italy expire, and painting becomes polyphonic, “picturesque,” infinity-seeking.
The colours become tones. The art of the brush claims kinship with
the style of cantata and madrigal. The technique of oils becomes the basis of
an art that means to conquer <em>space</em> and to dissolve things in that space. With
Leonardo and Giorgione begins Impressionism.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the actual picture there is transvaluation of all the elements. The background,
hitherto casually put in, regarded as a fill-up and, as space, almost
shuffled out of sight, gains a preponderant importance. A development sets
in that is paralleled in no other Culture, not even in the Chinese which in many
other respects is so near to ours. The background as symbol of the infinite
conquers the sense-perceptible foreground, and at last (herein lies the distinction
between the depicting and the delineating styles) the depth-experience of
the Faustian soul is captured in the kinesis of a picture. The space-relief of
Mantegna’s plane layers dissolves in Tintoretto into directional energy, and
there emerges in the picture the great symbol of an unlimited space-universe
which comprises the individual things within itself as incidentals—the <em>horizon</em>.
Now, that a landscape painting should have a horizon has always seemed
so self-evident to us that we have never asked ourselves the important question:
<em>Is</em> there always a horizon, and if not, when not and why not? In fact, there is
not a hint of it, either in Egyptian relief or in Byzantine mosaic or in vase-paintings
and frescoes of the Classical age, or even in those of the Hellenistic
in spite of its spatial treatment of foregrounds. This line, in the unreal vapour
of which heaven and earth melt, the sum and potent symbol of the far, contains
the painter’s version of the “infinitesimal” principle. It is out of the remoteness
of this horizon that the <em>music</em> of the picture flows, and for this reason the
great landscape-painters of Holland paint only backgrounds and atmospheres,
just as for the contrary reason “anti-musical” masters like Signorelli and
especially Mantegna, paint <em>only</em> foregrounds and “reliefs.” It is in the horizon,
then, that Music triumphs over Plastic, the <em>passion</em> of extension over its <em>substance</em>.
It is not too much to say that no picture by Rembrandt has a foreground
at all. In the North, the home of counterpoint, a deep understanding of the
meaning of horizons and high-lighted distances is found very early, while in
the South the flat conclusive gold-background of the Arabic-Byzantine picture
long remained supreme. The first definite emergence of the pure space-feeling
is in the Books of Hours of the Duke of Berry (that at Chantilly and that at
Turin) about 1416. Thereafter, slowly and surely, it conquers the Picture.</p>

<p class='c001'>The same symbolic meaning attaches to clouds. Classical art concerns itself
with them no more than with horizons, and the painter of the Renaissance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>treats them with a certain playful superficiality. But very early the Gothic
looked at its cloud-masses, and through them, with the long sight of mysticism;
and the Venetians (Giorgione and Paolo Veronese above all) discovered the
full magic of the cloud-world, of the thousand-tinted Being that fills the
heavens with its sheets and wisps and mountains. Grünewald and the Netherlanders
heightened its significance to the level of tragedy. El Greco brought
the grand art of cloud-symbolism to Spain.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was at the same time that along with oil-painting and counterpoint the
<em>art of gardens</em> ripened. Here, expressed on the canvas of Nature itself by extended
pools, brick walls, avenues, vistas and galleries, is the same tendency
that is represented in painting by the effort towards the linear perspective that
the early Flemish artists felt to be the basic problem of their art and Brunellesco,
Alberti and Piero della Francesca formulated. We may take it that it
was not entirely a coincidence that this formulation of perspective, this mathematical
consecration of the picture (whether landscape or interior) as a field
limited at the sides but immensely increased in depth, was propounded just
at this particular moment. It was the proclamation of the Prime-Symbol.
The point at which the perspective lines coalesce is at infinity. It was just
because it avoided infinity and rejected distance that Classical painting possessed
no perspective. <em>Consequently</em> the Park, the deliberate manipulation of
Nature so as to obtain space and distance effects, is an impossibility in Classical
art. Neither in Athens nor in Rome proper was there a garden-art: it was only
the Imperial Age that gratified its taste with ground-schemes of Eastern origin,
and a glance at any of the plans of those “gardens” that have been preserved<a id='r306'></a><a href='#f306' class='c019'><sup>[306]</sup></a> is
enough to show the shortness of their range and the emphasis of their bounds.
And yet the first garden-theorist of the West, L. B. Alberti, was laying down
the relation of the surroundings to the house (that is, to the spectators in it)
as early as 1450, and from his projects to the parks of the Ludovisi and Albani
villas,<a id='r307'></a><a href='#f307' class='c019'><sup>[307]</sup></a> we can see the importance of the perspective view into distance becoming
ever greater and greater. In France, after Francis I (Fontainebleau)
the long narrow lake is an additional feature having the same meaning.</p>

<p class='c001'>The most significant element in the Western garden-art is thus the <span lang="fr"><i>point de
vue</i></span> of the great Rococo park, upon which all its avenues and clipped-hedge
walks open and from which vision may travel out to lose itself in the distances.
This element is wanting even in the Chinese garden-art. But it is exactly
matched by some of the silver-bright distance-pictures of the pastoral music
of that age (in Couperin for example). It is the <span lang="fr"><i>point de vue</i></span> that gives us the
key to a real understanding of this remarkable mode of making nature itself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>speak the form-language of a human symbolism. It is in principle akin to the
dissolution of finite number-pictures into infinite series in our mathematic:
as the remainder-expression<a id='r308'></a><a href='#f308' class='c019'><sup>[308]</sup></a> reveals the ultimate meaning of the series, so
the glimpse into the boundless is what, in the garden, reveals to a Faustian
soul the meaning of Nature. It was <em>we</em> and not the Hellenes or the men of the
high Renaissance that prized and sought out high mountain tops for the sake
of the limitless range of vision that they afford. This is a Faustian craving—to
be <em>alone</em> with endless space. The great achievement of Le Nôtre and the landscape-gardeners
of Northern France, beginning with Fouquet’s epoch-making
creation of Vaux-le-Vicomte, was that they were able to render this symbol
with such high emphasis. Compare the Renaissance park of the Medicean
age—capable of being taken in, gay, cosy, well-rounded—with these parks
in which all the water-works, statue-rows, hedges and labyrinths are instinct
with the suggestion of long range. It is the Destiny of Western oil-painting
told over again in a bit of garden-history.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the feeling for long range is at the same time one for history. At a
distance, space becomes time and the horizon signifies the future. <em>The Baroque
park is the park of the Late season</em>, of the approaching end, of the falling leaf.
A Renaissance park is meant for the summer and the noonday. It is timeless,
and nothing in its form-language reminds us of mortality. It is perspective
that begins to awaken a premonition of something passing, fugitive and final.
The very words of distance possess, in the lyric poetry of all Western languages,
a plaintive autumnal accent that one looks for in vain in the Greek and Latin. It
is there in Macpherson’s “Ossian” and Hölderlin, and in Nietzsche’s Dionysus-Dithyrambs,
and lastly in Baudelaire, Verlaine, George and Droem. The Late
poetry of the withering garden avenues, the unending lines in the streets of a
megalopolis, the ranks of pillars in a cathedral, the peak in a distant mountain
chain—all tell us that the depth-experience which constitutes our space-world
for us is in the last analysis our inward certainty of a Destiny, of a
prescribed direction, of <em>time</em>, of the irrevocable. Here, in the experience of
horizon as future, we become directly and surely conscious of the identity of
Time with the “third dimension” of that experienced space which is living
self-extension. And in these last days we are imprinting upon the plan of our
megalopolitan streets the same directional-destiny character that the 17th
Century imprinted upon the Park of Versailles. We lay our streets as long
arrow-flights into remote distance, regardless even of preserving old and
historic parts of our towns (for the symbolism of these is not now prepotent
in us), whereas a megalopolis of the Classical world studiously maintained
in its extension that tangle of crooked lanes that enabled Apollinian
man to feel himself a body in the midst of bodies.<a id='r309'></a><a href='#f309' class='c019'><sup>[309]</sup></a> Herein, as always,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>practical requirements, so called, are merely the mask of a profound inward
compulsion.</p>

<p class='c001'>With the rise of perspective, then, the deeper form and full metaphysical
significance of the picture comes to be concentrated upon the horizon. In
Renaissance art the painter had stated and the beholder had accepted the contents
of the picture for what they were, as self-sufficient and co-extensive with
the title. But henceforth the contents became a <em>means</em>, the mere vehicle of a
meaning that was beyond the possibility of verbal expression. With Mantegna
or Signorelli the pencil sketch could have stood as the picture, without being
carried out in colour—in some cases, indeed, we can only regret that the artist
did not stop at the cartoon. In the statue-like sketch, colour is a mere supplement.
Titian, on the other hand, could be told by Michelangelo that he did
not know how to draw. The “object,” i.e., that which could be exactly fixed
by the drawn outline, the near and material, had in fact lost its artistic actuality;
but, as the theory of art was still dominated by Renaissance impressions,
there arose thereupon that strange and interminable conflict concerning the
“form” and the “content” of an art-work. Mis-enunciation of the question
has concealed its real and deep significance from us. The first point for consideration
should have been whether painting was to be conceived of plastically
or musically, as a static of things or as a dynamic of space (for in this lies the
essence of the opposition between fresco and oil technique), and the second
point, the opposition of Classical and Faustian world-feeling. Outlines define
the material, while colour-tones interpret space.<a id='r310'></a><a href='#f310' class='c019'><sup>[310]</sup></a> But the picture of the first
order belongs to directly sensible nature—it <em>narrates</em>. Space, on the contrary,
is by its very essence transcendent and addresses itself to our imaginative powers,
and in an art that is under its suzerainty, the narrative element enfeebles and
obscures the more profound tendency. Hence it is that the theorist, able to feel
the secret disharmony but misunderstanding it, clings to the superficial opposition
of content and form. The problem is purely a Western one, and reveals
most strikingly the complete inversion in the significance of pictorial elements
that took place when the Renaissance closed down and instrumental music of
the grand style came to the front. For the Classical mind no problem of form
and content in this sense could exist; in an Attic statue the two are completely
identical and identified in the human body.</p>

<p class='c001'>The case of Baroque painting is further complicated by the fact that it involves
an opposition of ordinary popular feeling and the finer sensibility.
Everything Euclidean and tangible is also popular, and the genuinely popular
art is therefore the Classical. It is very largely the feeling of this popular character
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>in it that constitutes its indescribable charm for the Faustian intellects
that have to <em>fight</em> for self-expression, to win their world by hard wrestling. For
us, the contemplation of Classical art and its intention is pure <em>refreshment</em>: here
nothing needs to be struggled for, everything offers itself freely. And something
of the same sort was achieved by the anti-Gothic tendency of Florence. Raphael
is, in many sides of his creativeness, distinctly popular. But Rembrandt is not,
cannot be, so. From Titian painting becomes more and more esoteric. So, too,
poetry. So, too, music. And the Gothic <span lang="la"><i>per se</i></span> had been esoteric from its very
beginnings—witness Dante and Wolfram. The masses of Okeghem and
Palestrina, or of Bach for that matter, were never intelligible to the average
member of the congregation. Ordinary people are bored by Mozart and Beethoven,
and regard music generally as something for which one is or is not in
the mood. A certain degree of interest in these matters has been induced by
concert room and gallery since the age of enlightenment invented the phrase
“art for all.” But Faustian art is not, and by very essence cannot be, “for all.”
If modern painting has ceased to appeal to any but a small (and ever decreasing)
circle of connoisseurs, it is because it has turned away from the painting of
things that the man in the street can understand. It has transferred the property
of actuality from contents to space—the space <em>through</em> which alone,
according to Kant, things <em>are</em>. And with that a difficult metaphysical element
has entered into painting, and this element does not give itself away to the layman.
For Phidias, on the contrary, the word “lay” would have had no meaning.
His sculpture appealed entirely to the bodily and not to the spiritual eye.
<em>An art without space is a priori unphilosophical.</em></p>

<h4 class='c021'>VII</h4>

<p class='c018'>With this is connected an important principle of <em>composition</em>. In a picture it
is possible to set the things inorganically above one another or side by side or
behind one another without any emphasis of perspective or interrelation, i.e.,
without insisting upon the dependence of their actuality upon the structure of
space which does not necessarily mean that this dependence is denied. Primitive
men and children draw thus, before their depth-experience has brought the
sense-impressions of their world more or less into fundamental order. But this
order differs in the different Cultures according to the prime symbols of these
Cultures. The sort of perspective composition that is so self-evident to us is a
particular case, and it is neither recognized nor intended in the painting of any
other Culture. Egyptian art chose to represent simultaneous events in superposed
ranks, thereby eliminating the third dimension from the look of the
picture. The Apollinian art placed figures and groups separately, with a deliberate
avoidance of space-and-time relations in the plane of representation.
Polygnotus’s frescoes in the Lesche of the Cnidians at Delphi are a celebrated
instance of this. There is no background to connect the individual scenes—for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>such a background would have been a challenge to the principle that things
alone are actual and space non-existent. The pediment of the Ægina temple,
the procession of gods on the François Vase and the Frieze of the Giants of
Pergamum are all composed as meander-syntheses of separate and interchangeable
motives, without organic character. It is only with the Hellenistic age
(the Telephus Frieze of the altar of Pergamum is the earliest example that has
been preserved) that the un-Classical motive of the consistent series comes into
existence. In this respect, as in others, the feeling of the Renaissance was truly
Gothic. It did indeed carry group-composition to such a pitch of perfection
that its work remains the pattern for all following ages. But the order of it all
proceeded out of space. In the last analysis, it was a silent music of colour-illumined
extension that created within itself <em>light-resistances</em>, which the understanding
eye could grasp as things and as existence, and could set marching
with an invisible swing and rhythm out into the distance. And with this
spatial ordering, with its unremarked substitution of air-and light-perspective
for line-perspective, the Renaissance was already, in essence, defeated.</p>

<p class='c001'>And now from the end of the Renaissance in Orlando Lasso and Palestrina
right up to Wagner, from Titian right up to Manet and Marées and Leibl,
great musicians and great painters followed close upon one another while the
plastic art sank into entire insignificance. Oil-painting and instrumental music
evolve organically towards aims that were comprehended in the Gothic and
achieved in the Baroque. Both arts—Faustian in the highest sense—are within
those limits <em>prime phenomena</em>. They have a soul, a physiognomy and therefore
a history. And in this they are alone. All that sculpture could thenceforward
achieve was a few beautiful incidental pieces in the shadow of painting, garden-art,
or architecture. The art of the West had no real need of them. There was
no longer a <em>style</em> of plastic in the sense that there were styles of painting or
music. No consistent tradition or necessary unity links the works of Maderna,
Goujon, Puget and Schlüter. Even Leonardo begins to despise the chisel outright:
at most he will admit the bronze cast, and that on account of its pictorial
advantages. Therein he differs from Michelangelo, for whom the marble
block was still the true element. And yet even Michelangelo in his old age
could no longer succeed with the plastic, and none of the later sculptors are
great in the sense that Rembrandt and Bach are great. There were clever and
tasteful performances no doubt, but not one single <em>work</em> of the same order as the
“Night Watch” or the “Matthew Passion,” nothing that expresses, as these
express, the whole depth of a whole mankind. This art had fallen out of the
destiny of the Culture. Its speech meant nothing now. What there is in a
Rembrandt portrait simply cannot be rendered in a bust. Now and then a
sculptor of power arises, like Bernini or the masters of the contemporary Spanish
school, or Pigalle or Rodin (none of whom, naturally, transcended the decorative
and attained the level of grand symbolism), but such an artist is always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>visibly either a belated imitator of the Renaissance like Thorwaldsen, a disguised
painter like Houdon or Rodin, an architect like Bernini and Schlüter or
a decorator like Coysevox. And his very appearance on the scene only shows
the more clearly that this art, incapable of carrying the Faustian burden, has no
longer a mission—and therefore no longer a soul or a life-history of specific
style-development—in the Faustian world. In the Classical world, correspondingly,
music was the art that failed. Beginning with probably quite
important advances in the earliest Doric, it had to give way in the ripe centuries
of Ionic (650-350) to the two truly Apollinian arts, sculpture and fresco; renouncing
harmony and polyphony, it had to renounce therewith any pretensions
to organic development as a higher art.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>VIII</h4>

<p class='c018'>The strict style in Classical painting limited its palette to yellow, red, black
and white. This singular fact was observed long ago, and, since the explanation
was only sought for in superficial and definitely material causes, wild hypotheses
were brought forward to account for it, e.g., a supposed colour-blindness in
the Greeks. Even Nietzsche discussed this (<span lang="de"><cite>Morgenröte</cite></span>, 426).</p>

<p class='c001'>But why did this painting in its great days <em>avoid</em> blue and even blue-green,
and only begin the gamut of permissible tones at greenish-yellow and bluish-red?
It is not that the ancient artists did not know of blue and its effect. The
metopes of many temples had blue backgrounds so that they should appear deep
in contrast with the triglyphs; and trade-painting used <em>all</em> the colours that were
technically available. There are authentic blue horses in archaic Acropolis
work and Etruscan tomb-painting; and a bright blue colouring of the hair
was quite common. The ban upon it in the higher art was, without a doubt,
imposed upon the Euclidean soul by its prime symbol.</p>

<p class='c001'>Blue and green are the colours of the heavens, the sea, the fruitful plain,
the shadow of the Southern noon, the evening, the remote mountains.
They are essentially atmospheric and not substantial colours. They are <em>cold</em>,
they disembody, and they evoke impressions of expanse and distance and
boundlessness.</p>

<p class='c001'>For this reason they were kept out of the frescoes of Polygnotus. And for
this reason also, an “infinitesimal” blue-to-green is the space-creating element
throughout the history of our perspective oil-painting, from the Venetians
right into the 19th Century; it is the basic and supremely important tone which
<em>supports</em> the ensemble of the intended colour-effect, as the <span lang="la"><i>basso continuo</i></span> supports
the orchestra, whereas the warm yellow and red tones are put on sparingly and
in dependence upon this basic tone. It is not the full, gorgeous and <em>familiar</em>
green that Raphael and Dürer sometimes—and seldom at that—use for
draperies, but an indefinite blue-green of a thousand nuances into white and
grey and brown; something deeply musical, into which (notably in Gobelin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>tapestry) the whole atmosphere is plunged. That quality which we have
named aerial perspective in contrast to linear—and might also have called
<em>Baroque</em> perspective in contrast to Renaissance—rests almost exclusively upon
this. We find it with more and more intense depth-effect in Leonardo, Guercino,
Albani in the case of Italy, and in Ruysdael and Hobbema in that of Holland,
but, above all, in the great French painters, from Poussin and Claude Lorrain
and Watteau to Corot. Blue, equally a perspective colour, always stands in
relation to the dark, the unillumined, the unactual. It does not press in on us,
it pulls us out into the remote. An “enchanting nothingness” Goethe calls it
in his <span lang="de"><cite>Farbenlehre</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Blue and green are transcendent, spiritual, non-sensuous colours. They are
missing in the strict Attic fresco and <em>therefore dominant</em> in oil-painting. Yellow
and red, the Classical colours, are the colours of the material, the near, the
full-blooded. Red is the characteristic colour of sexuality—hence it is the
only colour that works upon the beasts. It matches best the Phallus-symbol—and
therefore the statue and the Doric column—but it is pure blue that
etherealizes the Madonna’s mantle. This relation of the colours has established
itself in every great school as a deep-felt necessity. Violet, a red succumbing
to blue, is the colour of women no longer fruitful and of priests living in
celibacy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yellow and red are the <em>popular</em> colours, the colours of the crowd, of children,
of women, and of savages. Amongst the Venetians and the Spaniards high
personages affected a splendid black or blue, with an unconscious sense of the
aloofness inherent in these colours. For red and yellow, the <em>Apollinian, Euclidean-polytheistic</em>
colours, belong to the foreground even in respect of social life;
they are meet for the noisy hearty market-days and holidays, the naïve immediateness
of a life subject to the blind chances of the Classical <em>Fatum</em>, the point-existence.
But blue and green—the Faustian, monotheistic colours—are
those of loneliness, of care, of a present that is related to a past and a future,
of destiny as the dispensation governing the universe from within.</p>

<p class='c001'>The relation of Shakespearian destiny to space and of Sophoclean to the individual
body has already been stated in an earlier chapter. All the genuinely
transcendent Cultures—that is all whose prime-symbol requires the <em>overcoming</em>
of the apparent, the life of struggle and not that of acceptance—have the same
metaphysical inclination to space as to blues and blacks. There are profound
observations on the connexion between ideas of space and the meaning of colour
in Goethe’s studies of “entoptic colours” in the atmosphere; the symbolism
that is enunciated by him in the <span lang="de"><i>Farbenlehre</i></span> and that which we have deduced
here from the ideas of Space and Destiny are in complete agreement.</p>

<p class='c001'>The most significant use of dusky green as the colour of destiny is Grünewald’s.
The indescribable power of space in his <em>nights</em> is equalled only by Rembrandt’s.
And the thought suggests itself here, is it possible to say that his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>bluish-green, the colour in which the interior of a great cathedral is so often
clothed, is the specifically <em>Catholic</em> colour?—it being understood that we mean
by “Catholic” strictly the Faustian Christianity (with the Eucharist as its
centre) that was founded in the Lateran Council of 1215 and fulfilled in the
Council of Trent. This colour with its silent grandeur is as remote from the
resplendent gold-ground of Early Christian-Byzantine pictures as it is from
the gay, loquacious “pagan” colours of the painted Hellenic temples and
statues. It is to be noted that the effect of this colour, entirely unlike that of
yellow and red, depends upon work being exhibited <em>indoors</em>. Classical painting
is emphatically a public art, Western just as emphatically a studio-art. The
whole of our great oil-painting, from Leonardo to the end of the 18th Century,
is not meant for the bright light of day. Here once more we meet the same
opposition as that between chamber-music and the free-standing statue. The
climatic explanation of the difference is merely superficial; the example of
Egyptian painting would suffice to disprove it if disproof were necessary at all.
Infinite space meant for Classical feeling complete nothingness, and the use of
blue and green, with their powers of dissolving the near and creating the far,
would have been a challenge to the absolutism of the foreground and its unit-bodies,
and therefore to the very meaning and intent of Apollinian art. To the
Apollinian eye, pictures in the colours of Watteau would have been destitute
of all essence, things of almost inexpressible emptiness and untruth. By these
colours the visually-perceived light-reflecting surface of the picture is made
effectively to render, not circumscribed things, but circumambient space. And
that is why they are missing in Greece and dominant in the West.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>IX</h4>

<p class='c018'>Arabian art brought the Magian world-feeling to expression by means of
the <em>gold ground</em> of its mosaics and pictures. Something of the uncanny wizardry
of this, and by implication of its symbolic purpose, is known to us through
the mosaics of Ravenna, in the work of the Early Rhenish and especially North
Italian masters who were still entirely under the influence of Lombardo-Byzantine
models, and last but not least in the Gothic book-illustrations of
which the archetypes were the Byzantine purple codices.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this instance we can study the soul of three Cultures working upon very
similar tasks in very dissimilar ways. The Apollinian Culture recognized as
actual only that which was immediately present in time and place—and thus
it repudiated the background as pictorial element. The Faustian strove through
all sensuous barriers towards infinity—and it projected the centre of gravity
of the pictorial idea into the distance by means of perspective. The Magian
felt all happening as an expression of mysterious powers that filled the world-cavern
with their spiritual substance—and it shut off the depicted scene with
a gold background, that is, by something that stood beyond and outside all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>nature-colours. Gold is not a colour. As compared with simple yellow, it
produces a complicated sense-impression, through the metallic, diffuse refulgence
that is generated by its glowing surface. Colours—whether coloured
substance incorporated with the smoothed wall-face (fresco) or pigment applied
with the brush—are natural. But the metallic gleam, which is practically
never found in natural conditions, is unearthly.<a id='r311'></a><a href='#f311' class='c019'><sup>[311]</sup></a> It recalls impressively
the other symbols of the Culture, Alchemy and Kabbala, the Philosophers’
Stone, the Holy Scriptures, the Arabesque, the inner form of the tales of the
“Thousand and One Nights.” The gleaming gold takes away from the scene,
the life and the body their substantial being. Everything that was taught in
the circle of Plotinus or by the Gnostics as to the nature of things, their independence
of space, their accidental causes—notions paradoxical and almost
unintelligible to <em>our</em> world-feeling—is implicit also in the symbolism of this
mysterious hieratic background. The nature of bodies was a principal subject
of controversy amongst Neo-Pythagoreans and Neo-Platonists, as it was later
in the schools of Baghdad and Basra. Suhrawardi distinguishes extension, as
the primary existence of the body, from width and height and depth as its accidents.
Nazzâm pronounced against the corporeal substantiality and space-filling
character of the atom. These and the like were the metaphysical notions
that, from Philo and Paul to the last great names of the Islamic philosophy,
manifested the Arabian world-feeling. They played a decisive part in the disputes
of the Councils upon the substantiality of Christ.<a id='r312'></a><a href='#f312' class='c019'><sup>[312]</sup></a> And thus the gold
background possesses, in the iconography of the Western Church, an explicit
dogmatic significance. It is an express assertion of the existence and activity of
the divine spirit. It represents the <em>Arabian</em> form of the Christian world-consciousness,
and with such a deep appropriateness that for a thousand years this
treatment of the background was held to be the only one metaphysically—and
even ethically—possible and seemly in representations of the Christian legend.
When “natural” backgrounds, with their blue-green heavens, far horizons and
depth perspective, began to appear in early Gothic, they had at first the appearance
of something profane and worldly. The change of dogma that they implied
was, if not acknowledged, at any rate felt, witness the tapestry backgrounds
with which the real depth of space was covered up by a pious awe that disguised
what it dared not exhibit. We have seen how just at this time, when the
<em>Faustian</em> (German-Catholic) Christianity attained to consciousness of itself
through the institution of the sacrament of Contrition—a new religion in the
old garb—the tendency to perspective, colour, and the mastering of aerial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>space in the art of the Franciscans<a id='r313'></a><a href='#f313' class='c019'><sup>[313]</sup></a> transformed the whole meaning of
painting.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Christianity of the West is related to that of the East as the symbol of
perspective to the symbol of gold-ground—and the final schism took place
almost at the same moment in Church and in Art. The landscape-background
of the depicted scene and the <em>dynamic</em> infiniteness of God were comprehended at
the same moment; and, simultaneously with the gold ground of the sacred
picture, there vanished from the Councils of the West that Magian, ontological
problem of Godhead which had so passionately agitated Nicæa, Ephesus,
Chalcedon and all the Councils of the East.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>X</h4>

<p class='c018'>The Venetians discovered, and introduced into oil-painting as a space-forming
and quasi-musical motive, the handwriting of the <em>visible brush-stroke</em>.
The Florentine masters had never at any time challenged the fashion—would-be
Classical and yet in Gothic employ—of smoothing out all turns of the
brush so as to produce pure, cleanly-outlined and even colour-surfaces. In
consequence, their pictures have a certain air of <em>being</em>, something felt, unmistakably,
as the opposite of the inherent <em>motion</em>-quality of the Gothic
expression-means that were storming in from over the Alps. The 15th-Century
manner of applying colour is a denial of past and future. It is only in the
brushwork, which remains permanently visible and, in a way, perennially
fresh, that the <em>historical</em> feeling comes out. Our desire is to see in the work of
the painter not merely something that <em>has become</em> but something that <em>is becoming</em>.
And this is precisely what the Renaissance wanted to avoid. A piece of Perugino
drapery tells us nothing of its artistic origin; it is ready-made, given,
simply present. But the individual brush-strokes—first met with as a complete
new form-language in the later work of Titian—are accents of a personal
temperament, characteristic in the orchestra-colours of Monteverde,
melodically-flowing as a contemporary Venetian madrigal: streaks and dabs,
immediately juxtaposed, cross one another, cover one another, entangle one
another, and bring unending movement into the plain element of colour. Just
so the geometrical Analysis of the time made its objects become instead of being.
Every painting has in its execution a history and does not disguise it; and a
Faustian who stands before it feels that he too has a spiritual evolution. Before
any great landscape by a Baroque master, the one word “historical” is enough
to make us feel that there is a meaning in it wholly alien to the meaning of an
Attic statue. As other melody, so also this of the restless outlineless brush-stroke
is part of the dynamic stability of the universe of eternal Becoming,
directional Time, and Destiny. The opposition of painting-style and drawing-style
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>is but a particular aspect of the general opposition of historical and
ahistorical form, of assertion and denial of inner development, of eternity and
instantaneity. A Classical art-work is an event, a Western is a deed. The one
symbolizes the here-and-now point, the other the living course. And the
physiognomy of this script of the brush—an ornamentation that is entirely
new, infinitely rich and personal, and peculiar to the Western Culture—is
purely and simply <em>musical</em>. It is no mere conceit to compare the <span lang="it"><i>allegro feroce</i></span> of
Frans Hals with the <span lang="it"><i>andante con moto</i></span> of Van Dyck, or the minor of Guercino
with the major of Velasquez. Henceforward the notion of <em>tempo</em> is comprised in
the execution of a painting and steadily reminds us that this art is the art of a
soul which, in contrast to the Classical, forgets nothing and will let nothing be
forgotten that once was. The aëry web of brush-strokes immediately dissolves
the sensible surface of things. Contours melt into chiaroscuro. The beholder
has to stand a very long way back to obtain any corporeal impression out of
our coloured space values, and even so it is always the chromatic and active
air itself that gives birth to the things.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the same time with this, there appeared in Western painting another symbol
of highest significance, which subdued more and more the actuality of
all colour—the “studio-brown” (<span lang="de">atelierbraun</span>). This was unknown to the
early Florentines and the older Flemish and Rhenish masters alike. Pacher,
Dürer, Holbein, passionately strong as their tendency towards spatial depth
seems, are quite without it, and its reign begins only with the last years of the
16th Century. This brown does not repudiate its descent from the “infinitesimal”
greens of Leonardo’s, Schöngauer’s and Grünewald’s backgrounds,
but it possesses a mightier power over things than they, and it carries the battle
of Space against Matter to a decisive close. It even prevails over the more
primitive linear perspective, which is unable to shake off its Renaissance association
with architectural motives. Between it and the Impressionist technique
of the visible brush-stroke there is an enduring and deeply suggestive connexion.
Both in the end dissolve the tangible existences of the sense-world—the world
of moments and foregrounds—into atmospheric semblances. Line disappears
from the tone-picture. The Magian gold-ground had only dreamed of a mystic
power that controlled and at will could thrust aside the laws governing corporeal
existence within the world-cavern. But the brown of these pictures
opened a prospect into an infinity of pure forms. And therefore its discovery
marks for the Western style a culmination in the process of its becoming. <em>As
contrasted with the preceding green, this colour has something Protestant in it.</em> It anticipates
the hyperbolic<a id='r314'></a><a href='#f314' class='c019'><sup>[314]</sup></a> Northern pantheism of the 18th Century which the
Archangels voice in the Prologue of Goethe’s “Faust.”<a id='r315'></a><a href='#f315' class='c019'><sup>[315]</sup></a> The atmosphere of
Lear and the atmosphere of Macbeth are akin to it. The contemporary striving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>of instrumental music towards freer and ever freer chromatics (de Rore, Luca
Marenzio) and towards the formation of bodies of tone by means of string and
wind choruses corresponds exactly with the new tendency of oil-painting to
create <em>pictorial chromatics</em> out of pure colours, by means of these unlimited brown
shadings and the contrast-effect of immediately juxtaposed colour-strokes.
Thereafter both the arts spread through their worlds of tones and colours—colour-tones
and tone-colours—an atmosphere of the purest spatiality, which
enveloped and rendered, no longer body—the human being as a shape—but
the soul unconfined. And thus was attained the inwardness that in the deepest
works of Rembrandt and of Beethoven is able to unlock the last secrets themselves—the
inwardness which Apollinian man had sought with his strictly
somatic art to <em>keep at bay</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>From now onward, the old foreground-colours yellow and red—the
Classical tones—are employed more and more rarely and always as deliberate
contrasts to the distances and depths that they are meant to set off and emphasize
(Vermeer in particular, besides of course Rembrandt). This atmospheric brown,
which was entirely alien to the Renaissance, is the unrealest colour that there
is. It is the one major colour that <em>does not exist in the rainbow</em>. There is white
light, and yellow and green, and red and other light of the most entire purity.
But a pure brown light is outside the possibilities of the Nature that we know.
All the greenish-brown, silvery, moist brown, and deep gold tones that appear
in their splendid variety with Giorgione, grow bolder and bolder in the great
Dutch painters and lose themselves towards the end of the 18th Century, have
the common quality that they strip nature of her tangible actuality. They contain,
therefore, what is almost a religious profession of faith; we feel that here
we are not very far from Port Royal, from Leibniz. With Constable on the
other hand—who is the founder of the painting of <em>Civilization</em>—it is a different
will that seeks expression; and the very brown that he had learnt from the
Dutch meant to him not what it had meant to them—Destiny, God, the meaning
of life—but simply romance, sensibility, yearning for something that was
gone, memorial of the great past of the dying art. In the last German masters too—Lessing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>Marées, Spitzweg, Diez, Leibl<a id='r316'></a><a href='#f316' class='c019'><sup>[316]</sup></a>—whose belated art is a romantic
retrospect, an epilogue, the brown tones appear simply as a precious heirloom.
Unwilling in their hearts to part with this last relic of the great style, they
preferred to set themselves against the evident tendency of their generation—the
soulless and soul-killing generation of <span lang="fr"><i>plein-air</i></span> and Haeckel. Rightly
understood (as it has never yet been), this battle of Rembrandt-brown and the
<span lang="fr"><i>plein-air</i></span> of the new school is simply one more case of the hopeless resistance put
up by soul against intellect and Culture against Civilization, of the opposition
of symbolic necessary art and megalopolitan “applied” art which affects
building and painting and sculpture and poetry alike. Regarded thus, the
significance of the brown becomes manifest enough. When it dies, an entire
Culture dies with it.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was the masters who were inwardly greatest—Rembrandt above all—who
best understood this colour. It is the enigmatic brown of his most telling
work, and its origin is in the deep lights of Gothic church-windows and the
twilight of the high-vaulted Gothic nave. And the gold tone of the great
Venetians—Titian, Veronese, Palma, Giorgione—is always reminding us of
that old perished Northern art of glass painting of which they themselves know
almost nothing. Here also the Renaissance with its deliberate bodiliness of
colour is seen as merely an episode, an event of the very self-conscious surface,
and not a product of the underlying Faustian instinct of the Western soul,
whereas this luminous gold-brown of the Venetian painting links Gothic and
Baroque, the art of the old glass-painting and the dark music of Beethoven.
And it coincides precisely in time with the establishment of the Baroque style
of colour-music by the work of the Netherlanders Willaert and Cyprian de Rore,
the elder Gabrieli, and the Venetian music-school which they founded.</p>

<p class='c001'>Brown, then, became the characteristic colour of the <em>soul</em>, and more particularly
of a historically-disposed soul. Nietzsche has, I think, spoken somewhere
of the “brown” music of Bizet, but the adjective is far more appropriate to the
music which Beethoven wrote for strings<a id='r317'></a><a href='#f317' class='c019'><sup>[317]</sup></a> and to the orchestration that even
as late as Bruckner so often fills space with a browny-golden expanse of tone.
All other colours are relegated to ancillary functions—thus the bright yellow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>and the vermilion of Vermeer intrude with the spatial almost as though from
another world and with an emphasis that is truly metaphysical, and the
yellow-green and blood-red lights of Rembrandt seem at most to play with the
symbolism of space. In Rubens, on the contrary—brilliant performer but no
thinker—the brown is almost destitute of idea, a shadow-colour. (In him and
in Watteau, the “Catholic” blue-green disputes precedence with the brown.)
All this shows how any particular means may, in the hands of men of inward
depth, become a symbol for the evocation of such high transcendence as that of
the Rembrandt landscape, while for other great masters it may be merely a
serviceable technical expedient—or in other words that (as we have already
seen) technical “form,” in the theoretical sense of something opposed to
“content,” has nothing whatever to do with the real and true form of a great
work.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have called brown a historical colour. By this is meant that it makes the
atmosphere of the pictured space signify directedness and <em>future</em>, and overpowers
the assertiveness of any instantaneous element that may be represented.
The other colours of distance have also this significance, and they lead to an
important, considerable and distinctly bizarre extension of the Western symbolism.
The Hellenes had in the end come to prefer bronze and even gilt-bronze
to the painted marble, the better to express (by the radiance of this
phenomenon against a deep blue sky) the idea of the individualness of any
and every corporeal thing.<a id='r318'></a><a href='#f318' class='c019'><sup>[318]</sup></a> Now, when the Renaissance dug these statues up,
it found them black and green with the patina of many centuries. The historic
spirit, with its piety and longing, fastened on to this—and from that time
forth our form-feeling has canonized this black and green of distance. To-day
our eye finds it indispensable to the enjoyment of a bronze—an ironical illustration
of the fact that this whole species of art is something that no longer
concerns us as such. What does a cathedral dome or a bronze figure mean to
us without the patina which transmutes the short-range brilliance into the
tone of remoteness of time and place? Have we not got to the point of artificially
producing this patina?<a id='r319'></a><a href='#f319' class='c019'><sup>[319]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But even more than this is involved in the ennoblement of decay to the
level of an art-means of independent significance. That a Greek would have
regarded the formation of patina as the ruin of the work, we can hardly doubt.
It is not merely that the colour green, on account of its “distant” quality, was
avoided by him on spiritual grounds. Patina is a symbol of <em>mortality</em> and hence
related in a remarkable way to the symbols of time-measurement and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>funeral rite. We have already in an earlier chapter discussed the wistful regard
of the Faustian soul for ruins and evidences of the distant past, its proneness to
the collection of antiquities and manuscripts and coins, to pilgrimages to the
Forum Romanum and to Pompeii, to excavations and philological studies,
which appears as early as the time of Petrarch. When would it have occurred
to a Greek to bother himself with the ruins of Cnossus or Tiryns?<a id='r320'></a><a href='#f320' class='c019'><sup>[320]</sup></a> Every Greek
knew his “Iliad” but not one ever thought of digging up the hill of Troy. We,
on the contrary, are moved by a secret piety to preserve the aqueducts of the
Campagna, the Etruscan tombs, the ruins of Luxor and Karnak, the crumbling
castles of the Rhine, the Roman Limes, Hersfeld and Paulinzella from becoming
mere rubbish—but we keep them <em>as ruins</em>, feeling in some subtle way that reconstruction
would deprive them of something, indefinable in terms, that can
never be reproduced.<a id='r321'></a><a href='#f321' class='c019'><sup>[321]</sup></a> Nothing was further from the Classical mind than this
reverence for the weather-beaten evidences of a once and a formerly. It cleared
out of sight everything that did not speak of the present; never was the old
preserved because it was old. After the Persians had destroyed old Athens, the
citizens threw columns, statues, reliefs, broken or not, over the Acropolis wall,
in order to start afresh with a clean slate—and the resultant scrap-heaps have
been our richest sources for the art of the 6th Century. Their action was quite
in keeping with the style of a Culture that raised cremation to the rank of a
major symbol and refused with scorn to bind daily life to a chronology. <em>Our</em>
choice has been, as usual, the opposite. The heroic landscape of the Claude
Lorrain type is inconceivable without ruins. The English park with its atmospheric
suggestion, which supplanted the French about 1750 and abandoned
the great perspective idea of the latter in favour of the “Nature” of Addison,
Pope and sensibility, introduced into its stock of motives perhaps the most
astonishing bizarrerie ever perpetrated, the <em>artificial ruin</em>, in order to deepen
the historical character in the presented landscape.<a id='r322'></a><a href='#f322' class='c019'><sup>[322]</sup></a> The Egyptian Culture
restored the works of its early period, but it would never have ventured to <em>build</em>
ruins as the symbols of the past. Again, it is not the Classical statue, but the
Classical <em>torso</em> that we really love. It has had a destiny: something suggestive
of the past as past envelops it, and our imagination delights to fill the empty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>space of missing limbs with the pulse and swing of invisible lines. A good
restoration—and the secret charm of endless possibilities is all gone. I venture
to maintain that it is only by way of this <em>transposition into the musical</em> that
the remains of Classical sculpture can really reach us. The green bronze, the
blackened marble, the fragments of a figure abolish for our inner eye the limitations
of time and space. “Picturesque” this has been called—the brand-new
statue and building and the too-well-groomed park are not picturesque—and
the word is just to this extent, that the deep meaning of this weathering
is the same as that of the studio-brown. But, at bottom, what both express
is the spirit of instrumental music. Would the Spearman of Polycletus, standing
before us in flashing bronze and with enamel eyes and gilded hair, affect
us as it does in the state of blackened age? Would not the Vatican torso of
Heracles lose its mighty impressiveness if, one fine day, the missing parts were
discovered and replaced? And would not the towers and domes of our old
cities lose their deep metaphysical charm if they were sheathed in new copper?
Age, for us as for the Egyptian, ennobles all things. For Classical man, it
depreciates them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Lastly, consider Western tragedy; observe how the same feeling leads it to
prefer “historical” material—meaning thereby not so much demonstrably
actual or even possible, but <em>remote and crusted</em> subjects. That which the Faustian
soul wanted, and must have, could not be expressed by any event of purely
momentary meaning, lacking in distance of time or place, or by a tragic art
of the Classical kind, or by a timeless myth. Our tragedies, consequently, are
tragedies of the past and of the future—the latter category, in which men yet
to be are shown as carriers of a Destiny, is represented in a certain sense by
“Faust,” “Peer Gynt” and the “Götterdämmerung.” But tragedies of the
present we have <em>not</em>, apart from the trivial social drama of the 19th Century.<a id='r323'></a><a href='#f323' class='c019'><sup>[323]</sup></a>
If Shakespeare wanted on occasion to express anything of importance in the
present, he at least removed the scene of it to some foreign land—Italy for
preference—in which he had never been, and German poets likewise take
England or France—always for the sake of getting rid of that <em>nearness</em> of time
and place which the Attic drama emphasized even in the case of a mythological
subject.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>II<br> ACT AND PORTRAIT</h3>

<h4 class='c021'>I</h4>

<p class='c018'>The Classical has been characterized as a culture of the Body and the Northern
as a culture of the Spirit, and not without a certain <span lang="fr"><i>arrière-pensée</i></span> of disprizing
the one in favour of the other. Though it was mainly in trivialities that
Renaissance taste made its contrasts between Classical and Modern, Pagan and
Christian, yet even this might have led to decisive discoveries if only men
had seen how to get behind formula to origins.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the environment of a man (whatever else it may be) is with respect to him
a macrocosm with respect to a microcosm, an immense aggregate of symbols,
then the man himself, in so far as he belongs to the fabric of actuality, in so
far as he is <em>phenomenal</em>, must be comprised in the general symbolism. But, in
the impress of him made upon men like himself, what is it that possesses the
force of Symbol, viz., the capacity of summing within itself and intelligibly
presenting the essence of that man and the signification of his being? Art gives
the answer.</p>

<p class='c001'>But this answer is necessarily different in different Cultures. As each lives
differently, so each is differently impressed by Life. For the mode of human
imagining—metaphysical, ethical, artistic imagining alike—it is more than
important, it is determinant that the individual feels himself as a body amongst
bodies or, on the contrary, as a centre in endless space; that he subtilizes his
ego into lone distinctness or, on the contrary, regards it as substantially part of
the general consensus, that the directional character is asserted or, on the contrary,
denied in the rhythm and course of his life. In all these ways the prime-symbol
of the great Culture comes to manifestation: this is indeed a world-feeling,
but the life-ideal conforms to it. From the Classical ideal followed
unreserved acceptance of the sensuous instant, from the Western a not less
passionate wrestle to overcome it. The Apollinian soul, Euclidean and point-formed,
felt the empirical visible body as the complete expression of its own
way of being; the Faustian, roving into all distances, found this expression not
in <em>person</em>, σῶμα, but in <em>personality</em>, <em>character</em>, call it what you will. “Soul” for
the real Hellene was in last analysis the form of his body—and thus Aristotle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>defined it. “Body” for Faustian man was the vessel of the soul—and thus
Goethe felt it.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the result of this is that Culture and Culture differ very greatly in their
selection and formation of their humane arts. While Gluck expresses the woe
of Armida by a melody combined with drear gnawing tones in the instrumental
accompaniment, the same is achieved in Pergamene sculptures by making every
muscle speak. The Hellenistic portraiture tries to draw a spiritual <em>type</em> in the
structure of its heads. In China the heads of the Saints of Ling-yan-si tell of a
<em>wholly personal</em> inner life by their look and the play of the corners of the
mouth.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Classical tendency towards making the body the sole spokesman is
emphatically not the result of any carnal overload in the race (to the man of
σωφροσύνη wantonness was not permitted<a id='r324'></a><a href='#f324' class='c019'><sup>[324]</sup></a>), it was <em>not</em>, as Nietzsche thought,
an orgiastic joy of untrammelled energy and perfervid passion. This sort of
thing is much nearer to the ideals of Germanic-Christian or of Indian chivalry.
What Apollinian man and Apollinian art can claim as their very own is simply
the apotheosis of the bodily <em>phenomenon</em>, taking the word perfectly literally—the
rhythmic proportioning of limbs and harmonious build of muscles. This
is <em>not</em> Pagan as against Christian, it is Attic as against Baroque; for it was
Baroque mankind (Christian or unbeliever, monk or rationalist) that first
utterly put away the cult of the palpable σῶμα, carrying its alienation indeed to
the extremes of bodily uncleanliness that prevailed in the entourage of
Louis XIV,<a id='r325'></a><a href='#f325' class='c019'><sup>[325]</sup></a> whose full wigs and lace cuffs and buckled shoes covered up Body
with a whole web of ornament.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus the Classical plastic art, after liberating the form completely from
the actual or imaginary back-wall and setting it up in the open, free and
unrelated, to be seen as a body among bodies, moved on logically till
the <em>naked</em> body became its only subject. And, moreover, it is unlike every
other kind of sculpture recorded in art-history in that its treatment of
the bounding surfaces of this body is <em>anatomically convincing</em>. Here is the
Euclidean world-principle carried to the extreme; any envelope whatever
would have been in contradiction, however slightly, with the Apollinian
phenomenon, would have indicated, however timidly, the existence of the
circum-space.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this art, what is ornamental in the high sense resides entirely in the proportions
of the structure<a id='r326'></a><a href='#f326' class='c019'><sup>[326]</sup></a> and the equivalence of the axes in respect of support
and load. Standing, sitting, lying down but always self-secure, the body has,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>like the peripteros, no interior, that is, no “soul.” The significance of the
muscle-relief, carried out absolutely in the round, is the same as that of the self-closing
array of the columns; both contain the <em>whole</em> of the form-language of
the work.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was a strictly metaphysical reason, the need of a supreme life-symbol for
themselves, that brought the later Hellenes to this art, which under all the
consummate achievement is a narrow one. It is not true that this language
of the outer surface is the completest, or the most natural, or even the most
obvious mode of representing the human being. Quite the contrary. If the
Renaissance, with its ardent theory and its immense misconception of its own
tendency, had not continued to dominate our judgment—long after the plastic
art itself had become entirely alien to our inner soul—we should not have
waited till to-day to observe this distinctive character of the Attic style. No
Egyptian or Chinese sculptor ever dreamed of using external anatomy to express
his meaning. In Gothic image-work a language of the muscles is unheard
of. The human tracery that clothes the mighty Gothic framework with a web
of countless figures and reliefs (Chartres cathedral has more than <em>ten thousand</em>
such) is not merely ornament; as early as about 1200 it is employed for the
expression of schemes and purposes far grander than even the grandest of Classical
plastic. For these masses of figures constitute a <em>tragic</em> unit. Here, by the
North even earlier than by Dante, the historical feeling of the Faustian soul—of
which the deep sacrament of <em>Contrition</em> is the spiritual expression and the
rite of <em>Confession</em> the grave teacher—is intensified to the tragic fullness of a
world-drama. That which Joachim of Floris, at this very time, was seeing in
his Apulian cell—the picture of the world, not as Cosmos, but as a Divine
History and succession of three world-ages<a id='r327'></a><a href='#f327' class='c019'><sup>[327]</sup></a>—the craftsmen were expressing
at Reims, Amiens and Paris in serial presentation of it from the Fall to the Last
Judgment. Each of the scenes, each of the great symbolic figures, had its significant
place in the sacred edifice, each its rôle in the immense world-poem.
Then, too, each individual man came to feel how his life-course was fitted as
ornament in the plan of Divine history, and to experience this personal connexion
with it in the forms of Contrition and Confession. And thus these bodies of
stone are not mere servants of the architecture. They have a deep and particular
meaning of their own, the same meaning as the memorial-tomb brings to expression
with ever-increasing intensity from the Royal Tombs of St. Denis onward;
they speak of a <em>personality</em>. Just as Classical man properly meant, with his
perfected working-out of <em>superficial</em> body (for all the anatomical aspiration of
the Greek artist comes to that in the end), to exhaust the whole essence of the
living phenomenon in and by the rendering of its bounding surfaces, so Faustian
man no less logically found the most genuine, the only exhaustive, expression
of his life-feeling in the <em>Portrait</em>. The Hellenic treatment of the nude is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>the great exceptional case; in this and in this only has it led to an art of the
high order.<a id='r328'></a><a href='#f328' class='c019'><sup>[328]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><em>Act</em> and <em>Portrait</em> have never hitherto been felt as constituting an opposition,
and consequently the full significance of their appearances in art-history has
never been appreciated. And yet it is in the conflict of these two form-ideals
that the contrast of two worlds is first manifested in full. There, on the one
hand, an existence is made to show itself in the composition of the exterior
structure; here, on the other hand, the human interior, the Soul, is made to
speak of itself, as the interior of a church speaks to us through its façade or
face. A mosque had no face, and consequently the Iconoclastic movement of
the Moslems and the Paulicians—which under Leo III spread to Byzantium
and beyond—necessarily drove the portrait-element quite out of the arts of
form, so that thenceforward they possessed only a fixed stock of human arabesques.
In Egypt the face of the statue was equivalent to the pylon, the face
of the temple-plan; it was a mighty emergence out of the stone-mass of the
body, as we see in the “Hyksos Sphinx” of Tanis and the portrait of Amenemhet
III. In China the face is like a landscape, full of wrinkles and little signs
that mean something. But, for us, the portrait is <em>musical</em>. The look, the play
of the mouth, the pose of head and hands—these things are a fugue of the
subtlest meaning, a composition of many voices that <em>sounds</em> to the understanding
beholder.</p>

<p class='c001'>But in order to grasp the significance of the portraiture of the West more
specifically in contrast with that of Egypt and that of China, we have to consider
the deep change in the language of the West that began in Merovingian
times to foreshadow the dawn of a new life-feeling. This change extended
<em>equally</em> over the old German and the vulgar Latin, but it affected only the
tongues spoken in the countries of the coming Culture (for instance, Norwegian
and Spanish, but not Rumanian). The change would be inexplicable if we were
to regard merely the spirit of these languages and their “influence” of one upon
another; the explanation is in the spirit of the mankind that raised a mere way
of using words to the level of a symbol. Instead of <em>sum</em>, Gothic <em>im</em>, we say
<span lang="de"><i>ich bin</i></span>, <em>I am</em>, <span lang="fr"><i>je suis</i></span>; instead of <span lang="it"><i>fecisti</i></span>, we say <span lang="la"><i>tu habes factum</i></span>, <span lang="la"><i>tu as fait</i></span>, <i>du habes
gitân</i>; and again, <i>daz wîp</i>, <span lang="fr"><i>un homme</i></span>, <i>man hat</i>. This has hitherto been a riddle<a id='r329'></a><a href='#f329' class='c019'><sup>[329]</sup></a>
because families of languages were considered as beings, but the mystery is
solved when we discover in the idiom the reflection of a soul. The Faustian
soul is here beginning to remould for its own use grammatical material of the
most varied provenance. The coming of this specific “I” is the first dawning of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>that personality-idea which was so much later to create the sacrament of
Contrition and <em>personal</em> absolution. This <span lang="la">“ego habeo factum,”</span> the insertion of
the auxiliaries “have” and “be” between a doer and a deed, in lieu of the
“feci” which expresses activated body, replaces the world of bodies by one of
functions between centres of force, the static syntax by a dynamic. And this
“I” and “Thou” is the key to Gothic portraiture. A Hellenistic portrait is
the type of an attitude—a confession it is not, either to the creator of it or to
the understanding spectator. But our portraits depict something <span lang="la"><i>sui generis</i></span>,
once occurring and never recurring, a life-history expressed in a moment, a
world-centre for which everything else is world-around, exactly as the grammatical
subject “I” becomes the centre of force in the Faustian sentence.</p>

<p class='c001'>It has been shown how the experience of the extended has its origin in the
living <em>direction</em>, <em>time</em>, <em>destiny</em>. In the perfected “being” of the all-round nude
body the depth-experience has been cut away, but the “look” of a portrait
leads this experience into the supersensuous infinite. Therefore the Ancient art
is an art of the near and tangible and timeless, it prefers motives of brief, briefest,
pause between two movements, the last moment <em>before</em> Myron’s athlete
throws the discus, or the first moment after Pæonius’s Nike has alighted from
the air, when the swing of the body is ending and the streaming draperies have
not yet fallen—attitudes devoid equally of duration and of direction, disengaged
from future and from past. <span lang="la">“Veni, vidi, vici”</span> is just such another attitude.
But in "I—came, I—saw, I—conquered" there is a becoming each
time in the very build of the sentence.</p>

<p class='c001'>The depth-experience is a becoming and effects a become, signifies time and
evokes space, is at once cosmic and historical. Living direction marches to the
horizon as to the future. As early as 1230 the Madonna of the St. Anne entrance
of Notre-Dame dreams of this future: so, later, the Cologne “Madonna with
the Bean-blossom” of Meister Wilhelm. Long before the Moses of Michelangelo,
the Moses of Klaus Suter’s well in the Chartreuse of Dijon meditates
on destiny, and even the Sibyls of the Sistine Chapel are forestalled by those of
Giovanni Pisano in Sant’ Andrea at Pistoia (1300). And, lastly, there are the
figures on the Gothic tombs—how they rest from the long journey of Destiny
and how completely they contrast with the <em>timeless</em> grave and gay that is represented
on the stelæ of Attic cemeteries.<a id='r330'></a><a href='#f330' class='c019'><sup>[330]</sup></a> The Western portraiture is endless in
every sense, for it begins to wake out of the stone from about 1200 and it has
become completely music in the 17th Century. It takes its man not as a mere
centre of the World-as-Nature which as phenomenon receives shape and significance
from his being, but, above all, as a centre of the World-as-History.
The Classical statue is a piece of present “Nature” and nothing besides. The
Classical poetry is statuary in verse. Herein is the root of our feeling that
ascribes to the Greek an unreserved devotion to Nature. We shall never entirely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>shake off the idea that the Gothic style as compared with the Greek is
“unnatural.” Of course it is, for it is <em>more than</em> Nature; only we are unnecessarily
loath to realize that it is a deficiency in the Greek that our feeling has
detected. The Western form-language is richer—portraiture belongs to Nature
<em>and</em> to history. A tomb by one of those great Netherlanders who worked
on the Royal graves of St. Denis from 1260, a portrait by Holbein or Titian or
Rembrandt or Goya, is a <em>biography</em>, and a self-portrait is a historical <em>confession</em>.
To make one’s confession is not to avow an act but to lay before the Judge the
inner history of that act. The act is patent, its roots the personal secret. When
the Protestant or the Freethinker opposes auricular confession, it never occurs
to him that he is rejecting merely the outward form of the idea and not the idea
itself. He declines to confess to the priest, but he confesses to himself, to a
friend, or to all and sundry. The whole of Northern poetry is one outspoken
confession. So are the portraits of Rembrandt and the music of Beethoven.
What Raphael and Calderon and Haydn told to the priests, these men put into
the language of their works. One who is forced to be silent because the <em>greatness</em>
of form that can take in even the ultimate things has been denied him ...
goes under like Hölderlin. Western man lives in the <em>consciousness</em> of his becoming
and his eyes are constantly upon past and future. The Greek lives point-wise,
ahistorically, somatically. No Greek would have been capable of a
genuine self-criticism. As the phenomenon of the nude statue is the completely
ahistoric copy of a man, so the Western self-portrait is the exact
equivalent of the “Werther” or “Tasso” autobiography. To the Classical
both are equally and wholly alien. There is nothing so impersonal as Greek
art; that Scopas or Polycletus should make an image of himself is something
quite inconceivable.</p>

<p class='c001'>Looking at the work of Phidias, of Polycletus, or of any master later than
the Persian Wars, do we not see in the doming of the brow, the lips, the set of
the nose, the blind eyes, the expression of entirely non-personal, plantlike,
<em>soulless</em> vitality? And may we not ask ourselves whether this is the form-language
that is capable even of hinting at an inner experience? Michelangelo
devoted himself with all passion to the study of anatomy, but the phenomenal
body that he works out is always the expression of the activity of all bones,
sinews and organs of the <em>inside</em>; without deliberate intention, the living that is
under the skin comes out in the phenomenon. It is a physiognomy, and not a
system, of muscles that he calls to life. But this means at once that the personal
destiny and not the material body has become the starting-point of the
form-feeling. There is more psychology (and less “Nature”) in the arm of one
of his Slaves<a id='r331'></a><a href='#f331' class='c019'><sup>[331]</sup></a> than there is in the whole head of Praxiteles’s Hermes.<a id='r332'></a><a href='#f332' class='c019'><sup>[332]</sup></a> Myron’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>Discobolus,<a id='r333'></a><a href='#f333' class='c019'><sup>[333]</sup></a> on the other hand, renders the exterior form purely as itself, without
relation of any sort to the inner organs, let alone to any “soul.” One has
only to take the best work of this period and compare it with the old Egyptian
statues, say the “Village Sheikh”<a id='r334'></a><a href='#f334' class='c019'><sup>[334]</sup></a> or King Phiops (Pepi), or again with
Donatello’s “David,”<a id='r335'></a><a href='#f335' class='c019'><sup>[335]</sup></a> to understand at once what it means to recognize a
body purely with reference to its material boundaries. Everything in a head
that might allow something intimate or spiritual to become phenomenal the
Greeks (and markedly this same Myron) most carefully avoid. Once this
characteristic has struck us, the best heads of the great age sooner or later begin
to pall. Seen in the perspective of our world-feeling, they are stupid and dull,
wanting in the biographical element, devoid of any <em>destiny</em>. It was not out of
caprice that that age objected so strongly to votive images. The statues of
Olympian victors are representatives of a fighting attitude. Right down to
Lysippus there is not one single character-head, but only masks. Again, considering
the figure as a whole, with what skill the Greeks avoid giving any
impression that the head is the favoured part of the body! That is why these
heads are so small, so un-significant in their pose, so un-thoroughly modelled.
Always they are formed as a part of the body like arms and legs, never as the seat
and symbol of an “I.”</p>

<p class='c001'>At last, even, we come to regard the feminine (not to say effeminate) look
of many of these heads of the 5th, and still more of the 4th, Centuries<a id='r336'></a><a href='#f336' class='c019'><sup>[336]</sup></a> as the—no
doubt unintentional—outcome of an effort to get rid of personal character
entirely. We should probably be justified in concluding that the ideal
facial type of this art—which was certainly not an art for the people, as the
later naturalistic portrait-sculpture at once shows—was arrived at by rejecting
all elements of an individual or historical character; that is, by steadily
narrowing down the field of view to the pure Euclidean.</p>

<p class='c001'>The portraiture of the great age of Baroque, on the contrary, applies to
historical distance all those means of pictorial counterpoint that we already
know as the fabric of their spatial distance—the brown-dipped atmosphere,
the perspective, the dynamic brush-stroke, the quivering colour-tones and lights—and
with their aid succeeds in treating body as something intrinsically non-material,
as the highly expressive envelope of a space-commanding ego. (This
problem the fresco-technique, Euclidean that it is, is powerless to solve.) The
whole painting has only one theme, a soul. Observe the rendering of the hands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>and the brow in Rembrandt (e.g., in the etching of Burgomaster Six or the portrait
of an architect at Cassel), and again, even so late, in Marées and Leibl<a id='r337'></a><a href='#f337' class='c019'><sup>[337]</sup></a>—spiritual
to the point of dematerializing them, visionary, lyrical. Compare
them with the hand and brow of an Apollo or a Poseidon of the Periclean age!</p>

<p class='c001'>The Gothic, too, had deeply and sincerely felt this. It had draped body,
not for its own sake but for the sake of developing in the ornament of the
drapery a form-language consonant with the language of the head and the hands
in a fugue of Life. So, too, with the relations of the voices in counterpoint and,
in Baroque, those of the “continuo” to the upper voices of the orchestra. In
Rembrandt there is always interplay of bass melody in the costume and motives
in the head.</p>

<p class='c001'>Like the Gothic draped figure, the old Egyptian statue denies the intrinsic
importance of body. As the former, by treating the clothing in a purely ornamental
fashion, reinforces the expressiveness of head and hands, so the latter,
with a grandeur of idea never since equalled (at any rate in sculpture), holds
the body—as it holds a pyramid or an obelisk—to a mathematical scheme
and confines the personal element to the head. The fall of draperies was meant
in Athens to reveal the sense of the body, in the North to conceal it; in the one
case the fabric becomes body, in the other it becomes music. And from this
deep contrast springs the silent battle that goes on in high-Renaissance work
between the consciously-intended and the unconsciously-insistent ideals of the
artist, a battle in which the first—anti-Gothic—often wins the superficial,
but the second—Gothic becoming Baroque—invariably wins the fundamental
victory.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>II</h4>

<p class='c018'>The opposition of Apollinian and Faustian ideals of Humanity may now be
stated concisely. Act and Portrait are to one another as body and space, instant
and history, foreground and background, Euclidean and analytical number,
proportion and relation. The Statue is rooted in the ground, Music (and the
Western portrait <em>is</em> music, soul woven of colour-tones) invades and pervades
space without limit. The fresco-painting is tied to the wall, trained on it, but
the oil-painting, the “picture” on canvas or board or other table, is free from
limitations of place. The Apollinian form-language reveals only the become,
the Faustian shows above all a becoming.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is for this reason that child-portraits and family groups are amongst the
finest and most intimately right achievements of the Western art. In the Attic
sculpture this motive is entirely absent, and although in Hellenistic times the
playful motive of the Cupid or Putto came into favour, it was expressly as a
being <em>different</em> from the other beings and not at all as a person growing or becoming.
The child links past and future. In every art of human representation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>that has a claim to symbolic import, it signifies duration in the midst of phenomenal
change, the endlessness of Life. But the Classical Life exhausted itself
in the completeness of the moment. The individual shut his eyes to time-distances;
he comprehended in his thought the men like himself whom he saw
around him, but not the coming generations; and therefore there has never been
an art that so emphatically ignored the intimate representation of children as
the Greek art did. Consider the multitude of child-figures that our own art
has produced from early Gothic to dying Rococo—and in the Renaissance
above all—and find if you can in Classical art right down to Alexander one
work of importance that intentionally sets by the side of the worked-out body
of man or woman any child-element with existence still before it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Endless Becoming is comprehended in the idea of <em>Motherhood</em>, Woman as
Mother <em>is</em> Time and <em>is</em> Destiny. Just as the mysterious act of depth-experience
fashions, out of sensation, extension and world, so through motherhood the
bodily man is made an individual member of this world, in which thereupon
he <em>has</em> a Destiny. All symbols of Time and Distance are also symbols of maternity.
<em>Care</em> is the root-feeling of future, and all care is motherly. It expresses
itself in the formation and the idea of Family and State and in the principle of
Inheritance which underlies both. Care may be either affirmed or denied—one
can live care-filled or care-free. Similarly, Time may be looked at in the
light of eternity or in the light of the instant, and the drama of begetting and
bearing or the drama of the nursing mother with her child may be chosen as
the symbol of Life to be made apprehensible by all the means of art. India
and the Classical took the first alternative, Egypt and the West the second.<a id='r338'></a><a href='#f338' class='c019'><sup>[338]</sup></a>
There is something of pure unrelated present in the Phallus and the Lingam,
and in the phenomenon of the Doric column and the Attic statue as well.
But the nursing Mother points into the future, and she is just the figure that
is entirely missing in the Classical art. She could not possibly be rendered
in the style of Phidias. One feels that this form is opposed to the sense of
the phenomenon.</p>

<p class='c001'>But in the religious art of the West, the representation of Motherhood is the
noblest of all tasks. As Gothic dawns, the Theotokos of the Byzantine changes
into the Mater Dolorosa, the Mother of God. In German mythology she appears
(doubtless from Carolingian times only) as Frigga and Frau Holle. The
same feeling comes out in beautiful Minnesinger fancies like Lady Sun, Lady
World, Lady Love. The whole panorama of early Gothic mankind is pervaded
by something maternal, something caring and patient, and Germanic-Catholic
Christianity—when it had ripened into full consciousness of itself and in one
impulse settled its sacraments and created its Gothic Style—placed <em>not the
suffering Redeemer but the suffering Mother</em> in the centre of its world-picture. About
1250, in the great epic of statuary of Reims Cathedral, the principal place in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>centre of the main porch, which in the cathedrals of Paris and Amiens was still
that of Christ, was assigned to the Madonna; and it was about this time, too,
that the Tuscan school at Arezzo and Siena (Guido da Siena) began to infuse a
suggestion of mother-love into the conventional Byzantine Theotokos. And
after that the Madonnas of Raphael led the way to the purely human type of
the Baroque, the mother in the sweetheart—Ophelia, Gretchen—whose
secret reveals itself in the glorious close of Faust II and in its fusion with the
early Gothic Mary.</p>

<p class='c001'>As against these types, the imagination of the Greeks conceived goddesses
who are either Amazons like Athene or hetæræ like Aphrodite. In the root-feeling
which produced the Classical type of womanhood, fruitfulness has a
vegetal character—in this connexion as in others the word σῶμα exhaustively
expresses the meaning of the phenomenon. Think of the masterpieces of this
art, the three mighty female bodies of the East Pediment of the Parthenon,<a id='r339'></a><a href='#f339' class='c019'><sup>[339]</sup></a> and
compare with them that noblest image of a mother, Raphael’s Sistine Madonna.
In the latter, all bodiliness has disappeared. She is all distance and space. The
Helen of the “Iliad,” compared with Kriemhild, the motherly comrade of
Siegfried, is a courtesan, while Antigone and Clytæmnestra are Amazons.
How strangely even Æschylus passes over in silence the mother-tragic in Clytæmnestra!
The figure of Medea is nothing less than the mythic <em>inverse</em> of the
Faustian “Mater Dolorosa”; her tragic is not one of future or children, it is
with her lover, the symbol of wholly-present life, that her universe collapses.
Kriemhild revenges her unborn children—it is <em>this</em> future that has been murdered
in her—but Medea revenges only a past happiness. When the Classical
sculpture, <em>late</em> art that it is,<a id='r340'></a><a href='#f340' class='c019'><sup>[340]</sup></a> arrives at secularizing<a id='r341'></a><a href='#f341' class='c019'><sup>[341]</sup></a> the pictures of the god,
it creates the antique ideal of female form in a Cnidian Aphrodite—merely a
very beautiful object, not a character or an ego but a piece of Nature. And in
the end Praxiteles finds the hardihood to represent a goddess entirely naked.
This innovation met with severe criticism, for it was felt to be a sign of the
decline of the Classical world-feeling; suitable as it was to erotic symbolism, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>was in sharp contradiction with the dignity of the older Greek religion. But
exactly then, too, a portrait-art ventured to show itself, simultaneously with
the invention of a form that has never since been forgotten, the <em>bust</em>. Unfortunately
(here as elsewhere) art-research has made the mistake of discovering
in this the “beginnings” of “the” portrait. In reality, whereas a Gothic
visage speaks of an individual destiny, and even an Egyptian—in spite of the
rigid formalism of the figure—has the recognizable traits of the individual
person (since otherwise it could not serve as dwelling for the higher soul of the
dead, his <em>Ka</em>), the Greeks developed a taste for typical representations just as
the contemporary comedy produced standard men and situations, to which any
names whatever could be affixed. The “portrait” is distinguishable not by
personal traits but by the label only. This is the general custom amongst
children and primitive men, and it is connected with name-magic. The name
serves to capture some essence of what is named and to bind it as an object
which thereupon becomes specific for every beholder. The statues of the
Tyrannicides,<a id='r342'></a><a href='#f342' class='c019'><sup>[342]</sup></a> the (Etruscan) statues of Kings in the Capitol and the “iconic”
portraits of victors at Olympia must have been portraits of this sort, viz., not
likenesses but figures with names. But now, in the later phase, there was an
additional factor—the tendency of the time towards genre and applied art,
which produced also the Corinthian column. What the sculptors worked out
was the <em>types</em> of life’s stage, the ἦθος which we mistranslate by character but
which is really the kinds and modes of public behaviour and attitude; thus there
is “the” grave Commander, “the” tragic poet, “the” passion-torn actor,
“the” absorbed <a id='corr269.24'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='philospher'>philosopher</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_269.24'>philosopher</a></span>. Here is the real key to the understanding of the
celebrated Hellenistic portraiture, for which the quite unjustifiable claim has
been set up that its products are expressions of a deep spiritual life. It is not of
much moment whether the work bears the name of someone long dead—the
Sophocles<a id='r343'></a><a href='#f343' class='c019'><sup>[343]</sup></a> was sculptured about 340—or of a living man like the Pericles of
Cresilas.<a id='r344'></a><a href='#f344' class='c019'><sup>[344]</sup></a> It was only in the 4th Century that Demetrius of Alopeke began to
emphasize individual traits in the <em>external build</em> of the man and Lysistratus the
brother of Lysippus to copy (as Pliny tells us) a plaster-of-paris cast of the
subject’s face without much subsequent modification. And how little such
portraiture is portraiture in Rembrandt’s sense should surely have been obvious
to anyone. The <em>soul</em> is missing. The brilliant fidelity of Roman busts especially
has been mistaken for physiognomic depth. But what really distinguishes the
higher work from this craftsman’s and virtuoso’s work is an intention that is
the precise opposite of the artistic intention of a Marées or a Leibl. That is,
in such work the <a id='corr269.38'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='imporant'>important</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_269.38'>important</a></span> and significant is not <em>brought out</em>, it is <em>put in</em>. An
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>example of this is seen in the Demosthenes statue,<a id='r345'></a><a href='#f345' class='c019'><sup>[345]</sup></a> the artist of which possibly
saw the orator in life. Here the particulars of the body-surface are emphasized,
perhaps over-emphasized (“true to Nature,” they called this then), but into
the disposition so conceived he works the character-type of the Serious Orator
which we meet again on different bases in the portraits of Æschines and Lysias
at Naples. That is truth to life, undoubtedly, but it is truth to life as Classical
man felt it, typical and impersonal. We have contemplated the result with
<em>our</em> eyes, and have accordingly misunderstood it.</p>

<p class='c001'>sp 2</p>
<h4 class='c021'>III</h4>

<p class='c018'>In the oil-painting age that followed the end of the Renaissance, the depth
of an artist can be accurately measured by the content of his portraits. To this
rule there is hardly an exception. All forms in the picture (whether single,
or in scenes, groups or masses)<a id='r346'></a><a href='#f346' class='c019'><sup>[346]</sup></a> are fundamentally felt as portraits; whether
they are meant to be so or not is immaterial, for the individual painter has no
choice in the matter. Nothing is more instructive than to observe how under
the hands of a real Faustian man even the Act transforms itself into a portrait-study.<a id='r347'></a><a href='#f347' class='c019'><sup>[347]</sup></a>
Take two German masters like Lucas Cranach and Tilmann Riemenschneider
who were untouched by any theory and (in contrast to Dürer, whose
inclination to æsthetic subtlety made him pliant before alien tendencies)
worked in unqualified naïveté. They seldom depict the Act, and when they do
so, they show themselves entirely unable to concentrate their expression on the
immediately-present plane-specified bodiliness. The meaning of the human
phenomenon, and therefore of the representation of it, remains entirely in the
head, and is consistently physiognomical rather than anatomical. And the
same may be said of Dürer’s Lucrezia, notwithstanding his Italian studies and
the quite opposite intention. A Faustian <em>act</em> is a contradiction in itself—hence
the character-heads that we so often see on feeble act-representations (as
far back as the Job of old French cathedral-sculpture) and hence also the laborious,
forced, equivocal character that arouses our dislike in too manifest efforts
to placate the Classical ideal—sacrifices offered up not by the soul but by the
cultivated understanding. In the whole of painting after Leonardo there is not
one important or distinctive work that derives its meaning from the Euclidean
being of the nude body. It is mere incomprehension to quote Rubens here, and
to <a id='corr270.34'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='compre'>compare</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_270.34'>compare</a></span> his unbridled dynamism of swelling bodies in any respect whatever
with the art of Praxiteles and even Scopas. It is owing precisely to his splendid
sensuality that he is so far from the <em>static</em> of Signorelli’s bodies. If there ever
was an artist who could put a maximum of “becoming” into the beauty of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>naked bodies, who could treat bodily floridness <em>historically</em> and convey the
(utterly un-Hellenic) idea of an inexhaustible outflowing from within, it was
Rubens. Compare the horse’s head from the Parthenon pediment<a id='r348'></a><a href='#f348' class='c019'><sup>[348]</sup></a> with his
horses’ heads in the Battle of the Amazons,<a id='r349'></a><a href='#f349' class='c019'><sup>[349]</sup></a> and the deep metaphysical contrast
between the two conceptions of the same phenomenal element is felt at once.
In Rubens (recalling once more the characteristic opposition of Apollinian and
Faustian mathematics) the body is not magnitude but relation. What matters
is not the regimen of its external structure but the fullness of life that streams
out of it and the stride of its life along the road from youth to age, where the
Last Judgment that turns bodies into flames takes up the motive and intertwines
it in the quivering web of active space. Such a synthesis is entirely un-Classical;
but even nymphs, when it is Corot who paints them, are likewise shapes
ready to dissolve into colour-patches reflecting endless space. Such was <em>not</em> the
intention of the Classical artist when he depicted the Act.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the same time, the Greek form-ideal—the self-contained unit of being
expressed in sculpture—has equally to be distinguished from that of the
merely beautiful bodies on which painters from Giorgione to Boucher were
always exercising their cleverness, which are fleshly still-life, genre-work
expressing merely a certain gay sensuousness (e.g., “Rubens’s wife in a fur
cloak.”<a id='r350'></a><a href='#f350' class='c019'><sup>[350]</sup></a>) and in contrast with the high ethical significance of the Classical
Act have almost no symbolic force.<a id='r351'></a><a href='#f351' class='c019'><sup>[351]</sup></a> Magnificent as these men’s painting is,
therefore, they have not succeeded in reaching the highest levels either of
portraiture or of space-representation in landscape. Their brown and their
green and their perspective lack “religiousness,” future, Destiny. They are
masters only in the domain of <em>elementary</em> form, and when it has actualized this
their art is exhausted. It is they who constitute the substance-element in the
development-history of a great art. But when a great <em>artist</em> pressed on beyond
them to a form that was to be capable of embracing the whole meaning of the
world, he had necessarily to push to perfection the treatment of the nude
body if his world was the Classical, and <em>not</em> to do so if it was our North.
Rembrandt never once painted an Act, in this foreground sense, and if
Leonardo, Titian, Velasquez (and, among moderns, Menzel, Leibl, Marées
and Manet) did so at all, it was very rarely; and even then, so to say, they
painted bodies as <em>landscapes</em>. The portrait is ever the touchstone.<a id='r352'></a><a href='#f352' class='c019'><sup>[352]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>But no one would ever judge masters like Signorelli, Mantegna, Botticelli
or even Verrocchio, by the quality of their portraits. The equestrian statue of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>Can Grande<a id='r353'></a><a href='#f353' class='c019'><sup>[353]</sup></a> of 1330 is in a far higher sense a portrait than the Bartolommeo
Colleoni is; and Raphael’s portraits (the best of which e.g., Pope Julius II were
done under the influence of the Venetian Sebastian del Piombo), could be
ignored altogether in an appreciation of his creative work. It is only with
Leonardo that the portrait begins to count seriously. Between fresco-technique
and oil-painting there is a subtle opposition. In fact, Giovanni Bellini’s
“Doge” (Loredano)<a id='r354'></a><a href='#f354' class='c019'><sup>[354]</sup></a> is the first great oil-portrait. Here too the character of
the Renaissance as a protest against the Faustian spirit of the West betrays
itself. The episode of Florence amounts to an attempt to replace the Portrait
of the Gothic style (as distinct from the “ideal” portrait of late-Classical art,
which was well known through the Cæsar-busts) by the Act as human symbol.
Logically, therefore, the entire art of the Renaissance should be wanting in the
physiognomic traits. And yet the strong undercurrent of Faustian art-will kept
alive, not only in the smaller towns and schools of middle Italy, but also in the
instincts of the great masters themselves, a Gothic tradition that was never
interrupted. Nay, the physiognomic of Gothic art even made itself master of
the Southern nude body, alien as this element was. Its creations are not bodies
that speak to us through static definition of their bounding surfaces. What
we see is a <em>dumb-show</em> that spreads from the face over all parts of the body, and
the appreciative eye detects in this very <em>nudity</em> of Tuscany a deep identity with
the <em>drapery</em> of the Gothic. Both are envelopes, neither a limitation. The reclining
nude figures of Michelangelo in the Medici chapel are wholly and
entirely the visage and the utterance of a <em>soul</em>. But, above all, every head,
painted or modelled, became of itself a portrait, even when the heads were of
gods or saints. The whole of the portrait-work of A. Rossellino, Donatello,
Benedetto de Maiano, Mino da Fiesole, stands so near in spirit to that of
Van Eyck, Memlinc and the Early Rhenish masters as to be often indistinguishable
from theirs. There is not and there cannot be, I maintain, any genuine
Renaissance portraiture, that is, a portraiture in which just that artistic sentiment
which differentiates the Court of the Palazzo Strozzi from the Loggia dei
Lanzi and Perugino from Cimabue applies itself to the rendering of a visage.
In architecture, little as the new work was Apollinian in spirit, it was possible
to create anti-Gothically, but in portraiture—no. It was too specifically
Faustian a symbol. Michelangelo declined the task: passionately devoted as
he was to his pursuit of a plastic ideal, he would have considered it an abdication
to busy himself with portraiture. His Brutus bust is as little of a portrait
as his de’ Medici, whereas Botticelli’s portrait of the latter is actual,
and frankly Gothic to boot. Michelangelo’s heads are allegories in the style
of dawning Baroque, and their resemblance even to Hellenistic work is only
superficial. And however highly we may value the Uzzano bust of Donatello<a id='r355'></a><a href='#f355' class='c019'><sup>[355]</sup></a>—which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>is perhaps the most important achievement of that age and that
circle—it will be admitted that by the side of the portraits of the Venetians
it hardly counts.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is well worth noting that this overcoming of, or at least this desire to
overcome, the Gothic portrait with the Classical Act—the deeply historical
and biographical form by the completely ahistoric—appears simultaneously
with, and in association with, a decline in the capacity for self-examination and
artistic confession in the Goethian sense. The true Renaissance man did not
know what spiritual development meant. He managed to live entirely outwardly,
and this was the great good fortune and success of the Quattrocento.
Between Dante’s “Vita Nuova” and Michelangelo’s sonnets there is no poetic
confession, no self-portrait of the high order. The Renaissance artist and
humanist is the one single type of Western man for whom the word “loneliness”
remained unmeaning. His life accomplished its course in the light of a
<em>courtly</em> existence. His feelings and impressions were all public, and he had
neither secret discontents nor reserves, while the life of the great contemporary
Netherlanders, on the contrary, moved on in the shadow of their works. Is it
perhaps permissible to add that it was <em>because</em> of this that that other symbol of
historic distance, duration, care and ponderation, <em>the State</em>, also disappeared
from the purview of the Renaissance, between Dante and Michelangelo? In
“fickle Florence”—whose great men one and all were cruelly maltreated and
whose incapacity for political creation seems, by the side of other Western
state-forms, to border on sheer <span lang="fr"><i>bizarrerie</i></span>—and, more generally, wherever the
anti-Gothic (which in this connexion means anti-dynastic) spirit displayed
itself vigorously in art and public life, the State made way for a truly Hellenic
sorriness of Medicis, Sforzas, Borgias, Malatestas, and waste republics. Only
that city where sculpture gained <em>no</em> foothold, where the Southern music was
at home, where Gothic and Baroque joined hands in Giovanni Bellini and the
Renaissance remained an affair of occasional dilettantism, had an art of portraiture
and therewith a subtle diplomacy and a will to political duration—Venice.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>IV</h4>

<p class='c018'>The Renaissance was born of defiance, and therefore it lacked depth, width
and sureness of creative instinct. It is the one and only epoch which was more
consistent in theory than in performance and—in sharp contrast to Gothic and
Baroque—the only one in which theoretically-formulated intention preceded
(often enough surpassed) the ability to perform. But the fact that the individual
arts were forced to become satellites of a Classicist sculpture could not in
the last analysis alter the essence of them, and could only impoverish their
store of inward possibilities. For natures of medium size, the Renaissance
theme was not too big; it was attractive indeed from its very plainness, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>we miss consequently that Gothic wrestling with overpowering imprecise problems
which distinguishes the Rhenish and Flemish schools. The seductive ease
and clarity of the Renaissance rests very largely upon evasion—the evasion of
deeper reluctances by the aid of speciously simple rule. To men of the inwardness
of Memlinc or the power of Grünewald such conditions as those of the
Tuscan form-world would have been fatal. They could not have developed
their strength in and through it, but only against it. Seeing as we do no weakness
in the form of the Renaissance masters, we are very prone to overrate their
humanity. In Gothic, and again in Baroque, an entirely great artist was fulfilling
his art in deepening and completing its language, but in Renaissance he
was necessarily only destroying it.
“
So it was in the cases of Leonardo, Raphael and Michelangelo, the only
really great men of Italy after Dante. Is it not curious that between the masters
of the Gothic—who were nothing but silent workers in their art and yet
achieved the very highest that could be achieved within its convention and its
field—and the Venetians and Dutch of 1600—who again were purely workers—there
should be these three men who were not “sculptors” or "painters”
but <em>thinkers</em>, and thinkers who of necessity busied themselves not merely with
all the available means of artistic expression but with a thousand other things
besides, ever restless and dissatisfied, in their effort to get at the real essence
and aim of their being? Does it not mean—that in the Renaissance they could
not “find themselves”? Each in his own fashion, each under his own tragic
illusion, these three giants strove to be “Classical” in the Medicean sense; and
yet it was they themselves who in one and another way—Raphael in respect
of the line, Leonardo in respect of the surface, Michelangelo in respect of the
body—shattered the dream. In them the misguided soul is finding its way
back to its Faustian starting-points. What they <em>intended</em> was to substitute proportion
for relation, drawing for light-and-air effect, Euclidean body for pure
space. But neither they nor others of their time produced a Euclidean-static
sculpture—for that was possible once only, in Athens. In all their work one
feels a secret music, in all their forms the movement-quality and the tending into
distances and depths. They are on the way, not to Phidias but to Palestrina,
and they have come thither not from Roman ruins but from the still music of
the cathedral. Raphael thawed the Florentine fresco, and Michelangelo the
statue, and Leonardo dreamed already of Rembrandt and Bach. The higher and
more conscientious the effort to actualize the ideas of the age, the more intangible
it became.</p>

<p class='c001'>Gothic and Baroque, however, are something that <em>is</em>, while Renaissance is
only an ideal, unattainable like all ideals, that floats over the will of a period.
Giotto <em>is</em> a Gothic, and Titian <em>is</em> a Baroque, artist. Michelangelo <em>would be</em> a
Renaissance artist, but fails. Visibly, the plastic in him, for all its ambitiousness,
is overpowered by the pictorial spirit—and a pictorial spirit, too, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>which the Northern space-perspective is implicit. Even as soon as 1520 the
beautiful proportion, the pure rule—that is, the conscious Classical—are
felt as frigid and formal. The cornice which he put on to Sangallo’s purely
“Classical” façade of the Palazzo Farnese was no doubt, from the strictly
Renaissance standpoint, a disfigurement, but he himself and many with him
felt it to be far superior to the achievements of Greeks and Romans.</p>

<p class='c001'>As Petrarch was the first, so Michelangelo was the last Florentine who gave
himself up passionately to the Antique. But it was no longer an entire devotion.
The Franciscan Christianity of Fra Angelico, with its subtle gentleness and its
quiet, reflective piety—to which the Southern refinement of ripe Renaissance
work owes far more than has been supposed<a id='r356'></a><a href='#f356' class='c019'><sup>[356]</sup></a>—came now to its end. The
majestic spirit of the Counter-Reformation, massive, animated, gorgeous, lives
already in Michelangelo. There is something in Renaissance work which at
the time passed for being “Classical” but is really only a deliberately noble
dress for the Christian-German world-feeling; as we have already mentioned,
the combination of round-arch and pillar, that favourite Florentine motive, was
of Syrian origin. But compare the pseudo-Corinthian column of the 15th Century
with the columns of a real Roman ruin—remembering that these ruins
were known and on the spot! Michelangelo alone would tolerate no half-and-half.
Clarity he wanted and he would have. The question of form was for him
a religious matter; for him (and only for him) it was all or nothing. And this
is the explanation of the lonely fearful wrestlings of this man, surely the unhappiest
figure in our art; of the fragmentary, the tortured, the unsatisfied, the
<em>terribile</em> in his forms that frightened his contemporaries. The one half of his
nature drew him towards the Classical and therefore to sculpture—we all
know the effect produced upon him by the recently-discovered Laocoön. No
man ever made a more honest effort than he did to find a way with the chisel
into a buried world. Everything that he created he meant sculpturally—sculpturally,
that is, in a sense of the word that he and he alone stood for. “The
world, presented in the great Pan,” the element which Goethe meant to render
when he brought Helena into the Second Part of Faust, the Apollinian world in
all its powerful sensuous corporal presence—that was what Michelangelo was
striving with all his might to capture and to fix in artistic being when he was
painting the Sistine ceiling. Every resource of fresco—the big contours, the
vast surfaces, the immense nearness of naked shapes, the materiality of colour—was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>here for the last time strained to the utmost to liberate the paganism,
the high-Renaissance paganism, that was in him. But his second soul, the
soul of Gothic-Christian Dante and of the music of great expanses, is pulling
in the opposite sense; his scheme for the ensemble is manifestly metaphysical in
spirit.</p>

<p class='c001'>His was the last effort, repeated again and again, to put the entirety of the
artist-personality into the language of stone. But the Euclidean material
failed him. His attitude to it was not that of the Greek. In the very character
of its being the chiselled statue contradicts the world-feeling that tries to <em>find</em>
something by, and not to <em>possess</em> something in, its art-works. For Phidias,
marble is the cosmic stuff that is crying for form. The story of Pygmalion and
Galatea expresses the very essence of that art. But for Michelangelo marble
was the foe to be subdued, the prison out of which he must deliver his idea as
Siegfried delivered Brunhilde. Everyone knows his way of setting to work.
He did not approach the rough block coolly from every aspect of the intended
form, but attacked it with a passionate frontal attack, hewing into it as though
into space, cutting away the material layer by layer and driving deeper and
deeper until his form emerged, while the members slowly developed themselves
out of the quarry. Never perhaps has there been a more open expression of
world-dread in the presence of the become—Death—of the will to overpower
and capture it in vibrant form. There is no other artist of the West whose relation
to the stone has been that of Michelangelo—at once so intimate and so
violently masterful. It is his symbol of Death. In it dwells the hostile principle
that his daemonic nature is always striving to overpower, whether he is
cutting statues or piling great buildings out of it.<a id='r357'></a><a href='#f357' class='c019'><sup>[357]</sup></a> He is the one sculptor of his
age who dealt <em>only</em> with marble. Bronze, as cast, allows the modeller to compromise
with pictorial tendencies, and it appealed therefore to other Renaissance
artists and to the softer Greeks. The Giant stood aloof from it.</p>

<p class='c001'>The instantaneous bodily <em>posture</em> was what the Classical sculptor created,
and of this Faustian man was incapable. It is here just as it is in the matter of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>love, in which Faustian man discovers, not primarily the act of union between
man and woman, but the great love of Dante and beyond that the caring
Mother. Michelangelo’s erotic—which is that of Beethoven also—is as un-Classical
as it is possible to be. It stands <span lang="la"><i>sub specie æternitatis</i></span> and not under that
of sense and the moment. He produced acts—a sacrifice to the Hellenic idol—but
the soul in them denies or overmasters the visible form. He wills infinity
as the Greek willed proportion and rule, he embraces past and future as
the Greek embraced present. The Classical eye absorbs plastic form into itself,
but Michelangelo saw with the spiritual eye and broke through the foreground-language
of immediate sensuousness. And inevitably, in the long run, he
destroyed the conditions for this art. Marble became too trivial for his will-to-form.
He ceased to be sculptor and turned architect. In full old age, when
he was producing only wild fragments like the Rondanini Madonna and hardly
cutting his figures out of the rough at all, the <em>musical</em> tendency of his artistry
broke through. In the end the impulse towards contrapuntal form was no
longer to be repressed and, dissatisfied through and through with the art upon
which he had spent his life, yet dominated still by the unquenchable will to
self-expression, he <a id='corr277.18'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='shattereed'>shattered</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_277.18'>shattered</a></span> the canon of Renaissance architecture and created
the Roman Baroque. For relations of material and form he substituted the contest
of force and mass. He grouped the columns in sheaves or else pushed them
away into niches. He broke up the storeys with huge pilasters and gave the
façade a sort of surging and thrusting quality. Measure yielded to melody,
the static to the dynamic. And thus Faustian music enlisted in its service the
chief of all the other arts.</p>

<p class='c001'>With Michelangelo the history of Western sculpture is at an end. What of
it there was after him was mere misunderstandings or reminiscences. His real
heir was <em>Palestrina</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Leonardo speaks another language. In essentials his spirit reached forward
into the following century, and he was in nowise bound, as Michelangelo was
bound by every tie of heart, to the Tuscan ideal. He alone had neither the
ambition to be sculptor nor the ambition to be architect. It was a strange illusion
of the Renaissance that the Hellenic feeling and the Hellenic cult of the
exterior structure could be got at by way of anatomical studies. But when
Leonardo studied anatomy it was not, as in Michelangelo’s case, foreground
anatomy, the <em>topography</em> of human surfaces, studied for the sake of plastic, but
<em>physiology</em> studied for the inward secrets. While Michelangelo tried to force the
whole meaning of human existence into the language of the living body,
Leonardo’s studies show the exact opposite. His much-admired <span lang="it"><i>sfumato</i></span> is the
first sign of the repudiation of corporeal bounds, in the name of <em>space</em>, and as
such it is the starting-point of Impressionism. Leonardo begins with the
inside, the spiritual space within us, and not with the considered definition-line,
and when he ends (that is, if he ends at all and does not leave the picture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>unfinished), the substance of colour lies like a mere breathing over the real
structure of the picture, which is something incorporeal and indescribable.
Raphael’s paintings fall into planes in which he disposes his well-ordered
groups, and he closes off the whole with a well-proportioned background.
But Leonardo knows only one space, wide and eternal, and his figures, as it
were, float therein. The one puts inside a frame a sum of individual near things,
the other a portion cut out of the infinite.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Leonardo discovered the circulation of the blood.</em> It was no Renaissance spirit
that brought him to that—on the contrary, the whole course of his thought
took him right outside the conceptions of his age. Neither Michelangelo nor
Raphael could have done it, for their painter’s anatomy looks only at the form
and position, not the function, of the parts. In mathematical language, it is
stereometry as against analysis. Did not the Renaissance find it quite sufficient
preparation for great painted scenes to study <em>corpses</em>, suppressing the becoming
in favour of the become and calling on the dead to make Classical ἀταραξία
accessible to Northern creative energy? But Leonardo investigated the <em>life</em> in
the body as Rubens did, and not the body-in-itself as Signorelli did. His
discovery was contemporary with that of Columbus, and the two have a deep
affinity, for they signify the victory of the infinite over the material limitedness
of the tangibly present. Would a Greek ever have concerned himself with
questions like theirs? The Greeks inquired as little into the interior of their
own organization as they sought for the sources of the Nile; these were problems
that might have jeopardized the Euclidean constitution of their being.
The Baroque, on the other hand, is truly the <em>period of the great discoveries</em>. The
very word “discovery” has something bluntly un-Classical in it. Classical man
took good care not to take the cover, the material wrapping, off anything
cosmic, but to do <em>just this</em> is the most characteristic impulse of a Faustian nature.
The discoveries of the New World, the circulation of the blood, and the
Copernican universe were achieved almost simultaneously and, at bottom, are
completely equivalent; and the discovery of gunpowder (that is, the <em>long-range
weapon</em><a id='r358'></a><a href='#f358' class='c019'><sup>[358]</sup></a>) and of printing (the <em>long-range script</em>) were little earlier.</p>

<p class='c001'>Leonardo was a discoverer through-and-through, and discovery was the
sum in one word of his whole nature. Brush, chisel, dissecting-knife, pencil
for calculating and compasses for drawing—all were for him of equal importance.
They were for him what the Mariner’s Compass was for Columbus.
When Raphael completes with colour the sharp-drawn outline he asserts the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>corporeal phenomenon in every brush-stroke, but Leonardo, in his red-chalk
sketches and his backgrounds reveals aerial secrets with every line. He was
the first, too, who set his mind to work on aviation. To fly, to free one’s self
from earth, to lose one’s self in the expanse of the universe—is not this
ambition Faustian in the highest degree? Is it not in fact the fulfilment of
our dreams? Has it never been observed how the Christian legend became in
Western painting a glorious transfiguration of this motive? All the pictured
ascents into heaven and falls into hell, the divine figures floating above the
clouds, the blissful detachment of angels and saints, the insistent emphasis
upon freedom from earth’s heaviness, are emblems of soul-flight, peculiar to
the art of the Faustian, utterly remote from that of the Byzantine.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>V</h4>

<p class='c018'>The transformation of Renaissance fresco-painting into Venetian oil-painting
is a matter of <em>spiritual history</em>. We have to appreciate very delicate and subtle
traits to discern the process of change. In almost every picture from Masaccio’s
“Peter and the Tribute Money” in the Brancacci Chapel, through the soaring
background that Piero della Francesca gave to the figures of Federigo and
Battista of Urbino,<a id='r359'></a><a href='#f359' class='c019'><sup>[359]</sup></a> to Perugino’s “Christ Giving the Keys,”<a id='r360'></a><a href='#f360' class='c019'><sup>[360]</sup></a> the fresco manner
is contending with the invasive new form, though Raphael’s artistic development
in the course of his work on the Vatican “stanze” is almost the only case
in which we can see comprehensively the change that is going on. The Florentine
fresco aims at actuality in individual things and produces a sum of such
things in an architectonic setting. Oil-painting, on the other hand, sees and
handles with ever-growing sureness extension as a whole, and treats all objects
only as representatives thereof. The Faustian world-feeling created the new
technique that it wanted. It rejected the drawing style, as, from Oresme’s time,
co-ordinate geometry rejected it. It transformed the linear perspective associated
with the architectural motive into a purely aerial perspective rendered
by imponderable gradations of tone. But the condition of Renaissance art
generally—its inability either to understand its own deeper tendencies or to
make good its anti-Gothic principle—made the transition an obscure and
difficult process. Each artist followed the trend in a way of his own. One
painted in oils on the bare wall, and thereby condemned his work to perish
(Leonardo’s “Last Supper”). Another painted pictures as if they were wall-frescoes
(Michelangelo). Some ventured, some guessed, some fell by the way,
some shied. It was, as always, the struggle between hand and soul, between
eye and instrument, between the form willed by the artist and the form willed
by time—the struggle between Plastic and Music.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the light of this, we can at last understand that gigantic effort of Leonardo,
the cartoon of the “Adoration of the Magi” in the Uffizi. It is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>grandest piece of artistic daring in the Renaissance. Nothing like it was even
imagined till Rembrandt. Transcending all optical measures, everything then
called drawing, outline, composition and grouping, he pushes fearlessly on to
challenge eternal space; everything bodily floats like the planets in the Copernican
system and the tones of a Bach organ-fugue in the dimness of old churches.
In the technical possibilities of the time, so dynamic an image of distance could
only remain a torso.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the Sistine Madonna, which is the very summation of the Renaissance,
Raphael causes the outline to draw into itself the entire content of the work.
It is the <em>last grand line</em> of Western art. Already (and it is this that makes Raphael
the least intelligible of Renaissance artists) convention is strained
almost to breaking-point by the intensity of inward feeling. He did not indeed
wrestle with problems. He had not even an inkling of them. But he brought
art to the brink where it could no longer shirk the plunge, and he lived to
achieve the utmost possibilities <em>within</em> its form-world. The ordinary person
who thinks him flat simply fails to realize <em>what is going on</em> in his scheme. Look
again, reader, at the hackneyed Madonna. Have you ever noticed the little
dawn-cloudlets, transforming themselves into baby heads, that surround the
soaring central figure?—these are the multitudes of the unborn that the Madonna
is drawing into Life. We meet these light clouds again, with the same
meaning, in the wondrous finale of Faust II.<a id='r361'></a><a href='#f361' class='c019'><sup>[361]</sup></a> It is just that which does <em>not</em>
charm in Raphael, his sublime unpopularity, that betrays the inner victory over
the Renaissance-feeling in him. We do understand Perugino at a glance, we
merely think we understand Raphael. His very line—that drawing-character
that at first sight seems so Classical—is something that floats in space, supernal,
Beethoven-like. In this work Raphael is the least obvious of all artists,
less obvious even than Michelangelo, whose intention is manifest through all
the fragmentariness of his works. In Fra Bartolommeo the material bounding-line
is still entirely dominant. It is all foreground, and the whole sense of
the work is exhaustively rendered by the definition of bodies. But in Raphael
line has become silent, expectant, veiled, waiting in an extremity of tension
for dissolution into the infinite, into space and music.</p>

<p class='c001'>Leonardo <em>is</em> already over the frontier. The Adoration of the Magi <em>is</em> already
music. It is not a casual but a deeply significant circumstance that in this work,
as also in his St. Jerome,<a id='r362'></a><a href='#f362' class='c019'><sup>[362]</sup></a> he did not go beyond the brown underpainting, the
“Rembrandt” stage, the atmospheric brown of the following century. For
him, entire fullness and clearness of intention was attained with the work in
that state, and one step into the domain of colour (for that domain was still
under the metaphysical limitations of the fresco style) would have destroyed
the soul of what he had created. Feeling, in all its depth, the symbolism of
which oil-painting was later to be the vehicle, he was afraid of the fresco
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>“slickness” (Fertigkeit) that must have ruined his idea. His studies for this
painting show how close was his relation to the Rembrandt <em>etching</em>—an art
whose home was also that of the art (unknown to Florence) of counterpoint.
Only it was reserved for the Venetians, who stood outside the Florentine
conventions, to achieve what he strove for here, to fashion a colour-world
subserving space instead of things.</p>

<p class='c001'>For this reason, too, Leonardo (after innumerable attempts) decided to
leave the Christ-head in the “Last Supper” unfinished. The men of his time
were not even ripe for portraiture as Rembrandt understood the word, the
magistral building-up of a soul-history out of dynamic brush-strokes and lights
and tones. But only Leonardo was great enough to experience this limitation
as a Destiny. Others merely set themselves to paint heads (in the modes prescribed
by their respective schools) but Leonardo—the first, here, to make the
<em>hands</em> also speak, and that with a physiognomic maestria—had an infinitely
wider purpose. His soul was lost afar in the future, though his mortal part,
his eye and hand, obeyed the spirit of the age. Assuredly he was the freest of
the three great ones. From much of that which Michelangelo’s powerful nature
vainly wrestled with, he was already remote. Problems of chemistry, geometrical
analysis, physiology (Goethe’s “living Nature” was also Leonardo’s), the
technique of fire-arms—all were familiar to him. Deeper than Dürer, bolder
than Titian, more comprehensive than any single man of his time, he was
essentially the <em>artist of torsos</em>.<a id='r363'></a><a href='#f363' class='c019'><sup>[363]</sup></a> Michelangelo the belated sculptor was so, too,
but in another sense, while in Goethe’s day that which had been unattainable
for the painter of the Last Supper had already been reached and overpassed.
Michelangelo strove to force life once more into a dead form-world, Leonardo
felt a new form-world in the future, Goethe divined that there could be no new
form-worlds more. Between the first and the last of these men lie the ripe
centuries of the Faustian Culture.</p>

<h4 class='c026'>VI</h4>

<p class='c018'>It remains now to deal with the major characters of Western art during the
phase of accomplishment. In this we may observe the deep necessity of all
history at work. We have learned to understand arts as prime phenomena.
We no longer look to the operations of cause and effect to give unity to the
story of development. Instead, we have set up the idea of the <em>Destiny</em> of an
art, and admitted arts to be <em>organisms</em> of the Culture, organisms which are born,
ripen, age and <em>for ever</em> die.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the Renaissance—its last illusion—closes, the Western soul has
come to the ripe consciousness of its own strength and possibilities. It has
<em>chosen</em> its arts. As a “late” period, the Baroque knows, just as the Ionic had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>known, what the form-language of its arts has to mean. From being a philosophical
religion, art has to be a religious philosophy. Great masters come forward
in the place of anonymous schools. At the culmination of every Culture
we have the spectacle of a splendid <em>group of great arts</em>, well-ordered and linked
as a unit by the unity of the prime symbol underlying them all. The <em>Apollinian
group</em>, to which belong vase-painting, fresco relief, the architecture of ranked
columns, the Attic drama and the dance, centres upon the naked statue. The
<em>Faustian group</em> forms itself round the ideal of pure spatial infinity and its centre
of gravity is instrumental music. From this centre, fine threads radiate out into
all spiritual form-languages and weave our infinitesimal mathematic, our
dynamic physics, the propaganda of Jesuits and the power of our famous slogan
of “progress,” the modern machine-technique, credit economics and the
dynastic-diplomatic State—all into one immense totality of spiritual expression.
Beginning with the inward rhythm of the cathedral and ending with
Wagner’s “Tristan” and “Parsifal,” the artistic conquest of endless space
deploys its full forces from about 1550. Plastic is dying with Michelangelo in
Rome just when planimetry, dominant hitherto, is becoming the least important
branch of our mathematic. At the same time, Venice is producing
Zarlino’s theories of harmony and counterpoint (1558) and the practical method
of the <span lang="it"><i>basso continuo</i></span>—a perspective and an analysis of the world of sound—and
this music’s sister, the Northern mathematic of the Calculus, is beginning
to mount.</p>

<p class='c001'>Oil-painting and instrumental music, the arts of space, are now entering into
their kingdom. So also—<em>consequently</em>, we say—the two essentially material
and Euclidean arts of the Classical Culture, viz., the all-round statue and the
strictly planar fresco, attain to their primacy at the corresponding date of
c. 600 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> And further, in the one and in the other case, it is the painting that
ripens <em>first</em>. For in either kind painting on the plane is a less ambitious and more
accessible art than modelling in solid or composing in immaterial extension.
The period 1550-1650 belongs as completely to oil-painting as fresco and vase-painting
belong to the 6th Century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> The symbolism of space and of body,
expressed in the one case by perspective and in the other by proportion, are only
indicated and not immediately displayed by pictorial arts. These arts, which
can only in each case produce their respective prime-symbols (i.e., their possibilities
in the extended) as illusions on a painted surface, are capable indeed of
denoting and evoking the ideal—Classical or Western, as the case may be—but
they are not capable of <em>fulfilling</em> it; they appear therefore in the path of the
“late” Culture as the ledges before the last summit. The nearer the grand
style comes to its point of fulfilment, the more decisive the tendency to an
ornamental language of inexorable clarity of symbolism. The group of great
arts is further simplified. About 1670, just when Newton and Leibniz were
discovering the Differential Calculus, oil-painting had reached the limit of its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>possibilities. Its last great masters were dead or dying—Velasquez 1660,
Poussin 1665, Franz Hals 1666, Rembrandt 1669, Vermeer 1675, Murillo,
Ruysdael and Claude Lorrain 1682—and one has only to name the few successors
of any importance (Watteau, Hogarth, Tiepolo) to feel at once the descent,
the end, of an art. In this time also, the great forms of <em>pictorial</em> music expired.
Heinrich Schütz died in 1672, Carissimi in 1674, and Purcell in 1695—the last
great masters of the Cantata, who had played around image-themes with
infinite variety of vocal and instrumental colour and had painted veritable
pictures of fine landscape and grand legend-scene. With Lully (1687) the
heart of the heroic Baroque opera of Monteverde ceased to beat. It was
the same with the old “classical” sonata for orchestra, organ and string
trio, which was a development of image-themes in the fugal style. Thereafter,
the forms become those of final maturity, the concerto grosso, the
suite, and the three-part sonata for solo instruments. Music frees itself from
the relics of bodiliness inherent in the human voice and becomes absolute.
The theme is no longer an image but a pregnant <em>function</em>, existent only
in and by its own evolution, for the fugal style as Bach practised it can
only be regarded as a ceaseless process of differentiation and integration. The
victory of pure music over painting stands recorded in the Passions which
Heinrich Schütz composed in his old age—the visible dawn of the new form-language—in
the sonatas of Dall’Abaco and Corelli, the oratorios of Händel
and the Baroque polyphony of Bach. Henceforth this music is <em>the</em> Faustian
art, and Watteau may fairly be described as a painter-Couperin, Tiepolo as a
painter-Händel.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the Classical world the corresponding change occurred about 460, when
Polygnotus, the last of the great fresco-painters, ceded the inheritance of the
grand style to Polycletus and free sculpture in the round. Till then—as late
even as Polygnotus’s contemporaries Myron and the masters of the Olympia
pediment—the form-language of a purely planar art had dominated that of
statuary also; for, just as painting had developed its form more and more towards
the ideal of the <em>silhouette of colour with internal drawing superposed</em>—to such
an extent that at last there was almost no difference between the painted relief
and the flat picture—so also the sculptor had regarded the frontal <em>outline</em> as
it presented itself to the beholder as the true symbol of the Ethos, the cultural
type, that he meant his figure to represent. The field of the temple-pediment
constitutes a <em>picture</em>; seen from the proper distance, it makes exactly the same
impression as its contemporary the red-figure vase-painting. In Polycletus’s
generation the monumental wall-painting gives place to the board-picture,
the “picture” proper, in tempera or wax—a clear indication that the great
style has gone to reside elsewhere. The ambition of Apollodorus’s shadow
painting was not in any sense what we call chiaroscuro and atmosphere,
but sheer <em>modelling in the round</em> in the sculptor’s sense; and of Zeuxis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>Aristotle says expressly that his work lacked “Ethos.” Thus, this newer
Classical painting with its cleverness and human charm is the equivalent of
our 18th-Century work. Both lacked the inner greatness and both tried by
force of virtuosity to speak in the language of that single and final Art
which in each case stood for ornamentation in the higher sense. Hence
Polycletus and Phidias aline themselves with Bach and Händel; as the
Western masters liberated strict musical form from the executive methods of
the Painting, so the Greek masters finally delivered the statue from the associations
of the Relief.</p>

<p class='c001'>And with this full plastic and this full music the two Cultures reach their
respective ends. A pure symbolism of mathematical rigour had become possible.
Polycletus could produce his “canon” of the proportions of the human
body, and his contemporary Bach the <span lang="de">“Kunst der Fuge”</span> and <span lang="de">“Wohltemperiertes
Klavier.”</span> In the two arts that ensued, we have the last perfection of
achievement that pure form saturated with meaning can give. Compare the
tone-body of Faustian instrumental music, and within that system again the
body of the strings (in Bach, too, the virtual unity of the winds), with the
bodies of Attic statuary. Compare the meaning of the word “figure” to Haydn
with its meaning to Praxiteles. In the one case it is the figure of a rhythmic motive
in a web of voices, in the other the figure of an athlete. But in both cases
the notion comes from mathematics and it is made plain that the aim thus
finally attained is a union of the artistic and the mathematical spirit, for analysis
like music, and Euclidean geometry like plastic, have both come to full
comprehension of their tasks and the ultimate meaning of their respective
number-languages. The mathematics of beauty and the beauty of mathematics
are henceforth inseparable. The unending space of tone and the all-round body
of marble or bronze are <em>immediate</em> interpretations of the extended. They belong
to number-as-relation and to number-as-measure. In fresco and in oil-painting,
in the laws of proportion and those of perspective, the mathematical is only
indicated, but the two final arts <em>are</em> mathematics, and on these peaks Apollinian
art and Faustian art are seen entire.</p>

<p class='c001'>With the exit of fresco and oil-painting, the great masters of absolute plastic
and absolute music file on to the stage, man after man. Polycletus is followed
by Phidias, Pæonius, Alcamenes, Scopas, Praxiteles, Lysippus. Behind Bach
and Händel come Gluck, Stamitz, the younger Bachs, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven—in
their hands an armoury of wonderful and now long-forgotten
instruments, a whole magician’s world created by the discovering and inventing
spirit of the West in the hope of getting more and more tones and timbres for
the service and enhancement of musical expression—in their winds an abundance
of grand, solemn, ornate, dainty, ironic, laughing and sobbing forms of
perfectly regular structure, forms that no one now understands. In those days,
in 18th-Century Germany especially, there was actually and effectively a <em>Culture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>of Music</em> that suffused all Life. Its type was Hoffmann’s Kapellmeister
Kreisler. To-day it is hardly even a memory.</p>

<p class='c001'>And with the 18th Century, too, architecture died at last, submerged and
choked in the music of Rococo. On that last wonderful fragile growth of the
Western architecture criticism has blown mercilessly, failing to realize that its
origin is in the spirit of the fugue and that its non-proportion and non-form, its
evanescence and instability and sparkle, its destruction of surface and visual
order, are nothing else than a victory of tones and melodies over lines and
walls, the triumph of pure space over material, of absolute becoming over the
become. They are no longer buildings, these abbeys and castles and churches
with their flowing façades and porches and “gingerbread” courts and their
splendid staircases, galleries, salons and cabinets; they are sonatas, minuets,
madrigals in stone, chamber-music in stucco, marble, ivory and fine woods,
cantilene of volutes and cartouches, cadences of fliers and copings. The Dresden
Zwinger is the most completely musical piece in all the world’s architecture,
with an ornamentation like the tone of an old violin, an <span lang="it"><i>allegro fugitivo</i></span> for small
orchestra.</p>

<p class='c001'>Germany produced the great musicians <em>and therefore</em> also the great architects
of this century (Poppelmann, Schlüter, Bähr, Naumann, Fischer von Erlach,
Dinzenhofer). In oil-painting she played no part at all: in instrumental music,
on the contrary, hers was the principal rôle.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>VII</h4>

<p class='c018'>There is a word, “Impressionism,” which only came into general use in
Manet’s time (and then, originally, as a word of contempt like Baroque and
Rococo) but very happily summarizes the special quality of the Faustian way of
art that has evolved from oil-painting. But, as we ordinarily speak of it, the
idea has neither the width nor the depth of meaning that it ought to have: we
regard it as a sequel to or derivative of the old age of an art which, in fact,
belongs to it entirely and from first to last. What is the imitation of an "impression"?
Something purely Western, something related to the idea of
Baroque and even to the unconscious purposes of Gothic architecture and
diametrically opposed to the deliberate aims of the Renaissance. Does it not
signify the tendency—the deeply-necessary tendency of a waking consciousness
to feel pure endless space as <em>the</em> supreme and unqualified actuality, and all
sense-images as secondary and conditioned actualities "within it"? A tendency
that can manifest itself in artistic creations, but has a thousand other outlets
besides. Does not Kant’s formula "space as <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> form of perception" sound
like a slogan for the whole movement that began with Leonardo? Impressionism
is the inverse of the Euclidean world-feeling. It tries to get as far as possible
from the language of plastic and as near as possible to that of music. The effect
that is made upon us by things that receive and reflect light is made not because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>the things <em>are</em> there but as though they “in themselves” <em>are not</em> there. The
things are not even bodies, but light-resistances in space, and their illusive
density is to be unmasked by the brush-stroke. What is received and rendered
is the <em>impression</em> of such resistances, which are tacitly evaluated as simple functions
of a transcendent extension. The artist’s inner eye penetrates the body,
breaks the spell of its material bounding surfaces and sacrifices it to the majesty
of Space. And with this impression, under its influence, he feels an endless
<em>movement-quality</em> in the sensuous element that is in utter contrast to the statuesque
“Ataraxia” of the fresco. Therefore, there was not and could not be
any Hellenic impressionism; if there is one art that <em>must</em> exclude it on principle,
it is Classical sculpture.</p>

<p class='c001'>Impressionism is the comprehensive expression of a world-feeling, and it
must obviously therefore permeate the whole physiognomy of our “Late”
Culture. There is an impressionistic mathematic, which frankly and with intent
transcends all optical limitations. It is Analysis, as developed after
Newton and Leibniz, and to it belong the visionary images of number-“bodies,”
aggregates, and the multidimensional geometry. There is again an impressionistic
physics which “sees” in lieu of bodies systems of mass-points—units
that are evidently no more than constant relations between variable efficients.
There are impressionistic ethics, tragedy, and logic, and even (in Pietism) an
impressionistic Christianity.</p>

<p class='c001'>Be the artist painter or musician, his art consists in creating with a few
strokes or spots or tones an image of inexhaustible content, a microcosm meet
for the eyes or ears of Faustian man; that is, in laying the actuality of infinite
space under enchantment by fleeting and incorporeal indications of something
objective which, so to say, forces that actuality to become phenomenal. The
daring of these arts of moving the immobile has no parallel. Right from the
later work of Titian to Corot and Menzel, matter quivers and flows like a solution
under the mysterious pressure of brush-stroke and broken colours and
lights. It was in pursuit of the same object that Baroque music became “thematic”
instead of melodic and—reinforcing the “theme” with every expedient
of harmonic charm, instrumental colour, rhythm, and tempo—developed
the tone-picture from the imitative piece of Titian’s day to the leitmotiv-fabric
of Wagner, and captured a whole new world of feeling and experience. When
German music was at its culmination, this art penetrated also into lyric poetry
(German lyric, that is, for in French it is impossible) and gave rise to a whole
series of tiny masterpieces, from Goethe’s “Urfaust” to Hölderlin’s last poems—passages
of a few lines apiece, which have never yet been noticed, let alone
collected, but include nevertheless whole worlds of experience and feeling. On
a small scale, it continually repeats the achievements of Copernicus and Columbus.
No other Culture possesses an ornament-language of such dynamical impressiveness
relatively to the means it employs. Every point or stroke of colour,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>every scarce-audible tone releases some surprising charm and continually feeds
the imagination with fresh elements of space-creating energy. In Masaccio
and Piero della Francesca we have <em>actual bodies</em> bathed in air. Then Leonardo,
the first, discovers the transitions of <em>atmospheric</em> light and dark, the soft edges,
the outlines that merge in the depth, the domains of light and shade in which
the individual figures are inseparably involved. Finally, in Rembrandt, objects
dissolve into mere coloured impressions, and forms lose their specific humanness
and become collocations of strokes and patches that tell as elements of a
passionate depth-rhythm. Distance, so treated, comes to signify Future, for
what Impressionism seizes and holds is by hypothesis a unique and never-recurring
instant, not a landscape <em>in being</em> but a fleeting moment of the <em>history</em>
thereof. Just as in a Rembrandt portrait it is not the anatomical relief of the
head that is rendered, but the <em>second visage</em> in it that is confessed; just as the art
of his brush-stroke captures not the eye but the look, not the brow but the
experience, not the lips but the sensuousness; so also the impressionist picture
in general presents to the beholder not the Nature of the foreground but again
a <em>second visage</em>, the look and soul of the landscape. Whether we take the
Catholic-heroic landscape of Claude Lorrain, the “paysage intime” of Corot,
the sea and river-banks and villages of Cuyp and Van Goyen, we find always a
portrait in the physiognomic sense, something uniquely-occurring, unforeseen,
brought to light for the first and last time. In this love of the character and
physiognomy in landscape—just the motive that was unthinkable in fresco
art and permanently barred to the Classical—the art of portraiture widens
from the immediately human to the mediately human, to the representation of
the world as a part of the ego or the self-world in which the painter paints himself
and the beholder sees himself. For the expansion of Nature into Distance
reflects a <em>Destiny</em>. In this art of tragic, daemonic, laughing and weeping landscapes
there is something of which the man of another Culture has no idea and
for which he has no organ. Anyone who in the presence of this form-world
talks of Hellenistic illusion-painting must be unable to distinguish between an
ornamentation of the highest order and a soulless imitation, an ape-mimicry
of the obvious. If Lysippus said (as Pliny tells us he said) that he represented
men as they appeared to him, his ambition was that of a child, of a layman, of
a savage, not that of an artist. The great style, the meaning, the deep necessity,
are absent; even the cave-dwellers of the stone age painted thus. In reality,
the Hellenistic painters could do more when they chose. Even so late, the wall-paintings
of Pompeii and the “Odyssey” landscapes in Rome contain a <em>symbol</em>.
In each case it is a <em>group of bodies</em> that is rendered—rocks, trees, even “the Sea”
as a body among bodies! There is no depth, but only superposition. Of course,
of the objects represented one or several had necessarily to be furthest away (or
rather <em>least near</em>) but this is a mere technical servitude without the remotest
affinity to the illumined supernal distances of Faustian art.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>
  <h4 class='c021'>VIII</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>I have said that oil-painting faded out at the end of the 17th Century, when
one after another all its great masters died, and the question will naturally,
therefore, be asked—is Impressionism (in the current narrow sense) a creation
of the 19th Century? Has painting lived, after all, two centuries more? Is it
still existing? But we must not be deceived by appearances. Not only was there
a dead space between Rembrandt and Delacroix or Constable—for when we
think of the living art of high symbolism that was Rembrandt’s the purely
decorative artists of the 18th Century do not count—but, further, that which
began with Delacroix and Constable was, notwithstanding all technical continuity,
something quite different from that which had ended with Rembrandt.
The new <em>episode</em> of painting that in the 19th Century (i.e., beyond the 1800
frontier and in “Civilization”) has succeeded in awakening some illusion of a
great culture of painting, has itself chosen the word <span lang="fr"><i>Plein-air</i></span> (<span lang="de"><i>Freilicht</i></span>) to
designate its special characteristic. The very designation suffices to show the
significance of the fleeting phenomenon that it is. It implies the conscious,
intellectual, cold-blooded rejection of that for which a sudden wit invented the
name “brown sauce,” but which the great masters had, as we know, regarded
as the one truly metaphysical colour. On it had been built the painting-culture
of the schools, and especially the Dutch school, that had vanished irretrievably
in the Rococo. This brown, the symbol of a spatial infinity, which had for
Faustian mankind created a spiritual something out of a mere canvas, now came
to be regarded, quite suddenly, as an offence to Nature. What had happened?
Was it not simply this, that the <em>soul</em> for which this supernal colour was something
religious, the sign of wistfulness, the whole meaning of “Living Nature,”
had quietly slipped away? The materialism of a Western Cosmopolis blew into
the ashes and rekindled this curious brief flicker—a brief flicker of two generations,
for with the generation of Manet all was ended again. I have (as the
reader will recall) characterized the noble green of Grünewald and Claude and
Giorgione as the Catholic space-colour and the transcendent brown of Rembrandt
as the colour of the Protestant world-feeling. On the other hand,
<span lang="fr"><i>Plein-air</i></span> and its new colour scale stand for irreligion.<a id='r364'></a><a href='#f364' class='c019'><sup>[364]</sup></a> From the spheres of
Beethoven and the stellar expanses of Kant, Impressionism has come down
again to the crust of the earth. Its space is cognized, not experienced, seen, not
contemplated; there is tunedness in it, but not Destiny. It is the mechanical
object of physics and not the felt world of the pastorale that Courbet and Manet
give us in their landscapes. Rousseau’s tragically correct prophecy of a “return
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>to Nature” fulfils itself in this dying art—the senile, too, return to Nature
day by day. The modern artist is a workman, not a creator. He sets unbroken
spectrum-colours side by side. The subtle script, the dance of brush-strokes,
give way to crude commonplaces, pilings and mixings and daubings of points,
squares, broad inorganic masses. The whitewasher’s brush and the trowel appear
in the painter’s equipment; the oil-priming of the canvas is brought into
the scheme of execution and in places left bare. It is a risky art, meticulous,
cold, diseased—an art for over-developed nerves, but scientific to the last
degree, energetic in everything that relates to the conquest of technical obstacles,
acutely assertive of programme. It is the “satyric pendant” of the
great age of oil-painting that stretches from Leonardo to Rembrandt; it could
only be at home in the Paris of Baudelaire. Corot’s silvern landscapes, with
their grey-greens and browns, dream still of the spiritual of the Old Masters;
but Courbet and Manet conquer bare physical space, “factual” space. The
meditative discoverer represented by Leonardo gives way to the painting
experimentalist. Corot, the eternal child, French but not Parisian, finds his
transcendent landscapes anywhere and everywhere; Courbet, Manet, Cézanne,
portray over and over again, painfully, laboriously, soullessly, the Forest of
Fontainebleau, the bank of the Seine at Argenteuil, or that remarkable valley
near Arles. Rembrandt’s mighty landscapes lie essentially in the universe,
Manet’s near a railway station. The plein-air painters, true megalopolitans,
obtain as it were specimens of the music of space from the least agitated
sources of Spain and Holland—from Velasquez, Goya, Hobbema, Franz Hals—in
order (with the aid of English landscapists and, later, the Japanese,
“highbrows” all) to restate it in empirical and scientific terms. It is natural
science as opposed to nature experience, head against heart, knowledge in
contrast to faith.</p>

<p class='c001'>In Germany it was otherwise. Whereas in France it was a matter of closing-off
the great school, in Germany it was a case of catching up with it. For in the
picturesque style, as practised from Rottmann, Wasmann, K. D. Friedrich and
Runge to Marées and Leibl, an unbroken evolution is the very basis of technique,
and even a new-style school requires a closed tradition behind it. Herein
lies the weakness and the strength of the last German painters. Whereas the
French possessed a continuous tradition of their own from early Baroque to
Chardin and Corot, whereas there was living connexion between Claude Lorrain
and Corot, Rubens and Delacroix, all the great Germans of the 18th Century
had been <em>musicians</em>. After Beethoven this music, without change of inward
essence, was diverted (one of the modalities of the German Romantic movement)
back into painting. And it was in painting that it flowered longest and
bore its kindliest fruits, for the portraits and landscapes of these men are suffused
with a secret wistful music, and there is a breath of Eichendorff and
Mörike left even in Thoma and Böcklin. But a foreign teacher had to be asked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>to supply that which was lacking in the native tradition, and so these painters
one and all went to Paris, where they studied and copied the old masters of
1670. So also did Manet and his circle. But there was this difference, that the
Frenchmen found in these studies only reminiscences of something that had been
in their art for many generations, whereas the Germans received fresh and
wholly different impressions. The result was that, in the 19th Century, the
German arts of form (other than music) were a phenomenon out of season—hasty,
anxious, confused, puzzled as to both aim and means. There was indeed
no time to be lost. The level that German music or French painting had taken
centuries to attain had to be made good by German painting in two generations.
The expiring art demanded its last phase, and this phase had to be reached by a
vertiginous race through the whole past. Hence the unsteadiness, in everything
pertaining to form, of high Faustian natures like Marées and Böcklin,
an unsteadiness that in German music with its sure tradition (think of Bruckner)
would have been impossible. The art of the French Impressionists was too
explicit in its programme and correspondingly too poor in soul to expose them
to such a tragedy. German literature, on the contrary, was in the same condition
as German painting; from Goethe’s time, every major work was intended
to found something <em>and</em> obliged to conclude something. Just as Kleist felt in
himself both Shakespeare and Stendhal, and laboured desperately, altering and
discarding without end and without result, to forge two centuries of psychological
art into a unit; just as Hebbel tried to squeeze all the problems from
Hamlet to Rosmersholm into one dramatic type; so Menzel, Leibl, and Marées
sought to force the old and new models—Rembrandt, Claude, Van Goyen, and
Watteau, Delacroix, Courbet and Manet—into a single form. While the little
early interiors of Menzel anticipated all the discoveries of the Manet circle and
Leibl not seldom succeeded where Courbet tried and failed, their pictures renew
the metaphysical browns and greens of the Old Masters and are fully expressive
of an inward experience. Menzel <em>actually</em> re-experienced and reawakened something
of Prussian Rococo, Marées something of Rubens, Leibl in his “Frau
Gedon” something of Rembrandt’s <a id='corr290.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='protraiture'>portraiture</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_290.31'>portraiture</a></span>. Moreover, the studio-brown
of the 17th Century had had by its side a second art, the intensely Faustian art
of etching. In this, as in the other, Rembrandt is the greatest master of all
time; this, like the other, has something Protestant in it that puts it in a quite
different category from the work of the Southern Catholic painters of blue-green
atmospheres and the Gobelin tapestries. And Leibl, the last artist in the
brown, was the last great etcher whose plates possess that Rembrandtesque
infinity that contains and reveals secrets without end. In Marées, lastly, there
was all the mighty intention of the great Baroque style, but, though Guéricault
and Daumier were not too belated to capture it in positive form, he—lacking
just that strength that a tradition would have given him—was unable to
force it into the world of painter’s actuality.</p>

  <h4 class='c021'>IX</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The last of the Faustian arts died in “Tristan.” This work is the giant
keystone of Western music. Painting achieved nothing like this as a finale—on
the contrary, the effect of Manet, Menzel and Leibl, with their combination
of “free light” and resurrected old-master styles, is weak.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Contemporaneously,” in our sense, Apollinian art came to its end in Pergamene
sculpture. <em>Pergamum is the counterpart of Bayreuth.</em> The famous altar
itself,<a id='r365'></a><a href='#f365' class='c019'><sup>[365]</sup></a> indeed, is later, and probably not the most important work of the epoch
at that; we have to assume a century (330-220 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>) of development now lost
in oblivion. Nevertheless, all Nietzsche’s charges against Wagner and Bayreuth,
the “Ring” and “Parsifal”—decadence, theatricalness and the like—could
have been levelled in the same words at the Pergamene sculpture. A
masterpiece of this sculpture—a veritable “Ring”—has come down to us
in the Gigantomachia frieze of the great altar. Here is the same theatrical note,
the same use of motives from ancient discredited mythology as <i>points d’appui</i>,
the same ruthless bombardment of the nerves, and also (though the lack of
inner power cannot altogether be concealed) the same fully self-conscious force
and towering greatness. To this art the Farnese Bull and the older model of
the Laocoön group certainly belong.</p>

<p class='c001'>The symptom of decline in creative power is the fact that to produce something
round and complete the artist now requires to be emancipated from form
and proportion. Its most obvious, though not its most significant, manifestation
is the taste for the gigantic. Here size is not, as in the Gothic and the
Pyramid styles, the expression of inward greatness, but the dissimulation of its
absence. This swaggering in <em>specious</em> dimensions is common to all nascent
Civilizations—we find it in the Zeus altar of Pergamum, the Helios of Chares
called the “Colossus of Rhodes,” the architecture of the Roman Imperial Age,
the New Empire work in Egypt, the American skyscraper of to-day. But what
is far more indicative is the arbitrariness and immoderateness that tramples on
and shatters the conventions of centuries. In Bayreuth and in Pergamum, it
was the superpersonal Rule, the absolute mathematic of Form, the Destiny
immanent in the quietly-matured language of a great art, that was found to be
intolerable. The way from Polycletus to Lysippus and from Lysippus to the
sculptors of the groups of Gauls<a id='r366'></a><a href='#f366' class='c019'><sup>[366]</sup></a> is paralleled by the way from Bach, by Beethoven,
to Wagner. The earlier artists felt themselves masters, the later uneasy
slaves, of the great form. While even Praxiteles and Haydn were able to speak
freely and gaily within the limits of the strictest canon, Lysippus and Beethoven
could only produce by straining their voices. The sign of all living art,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>the pure harmony of “will,” “must” and “can,” the self-evidence of the aim,
the un-self-consciousness of the execution, the unity of the art and the Culture—all
that is past and gone. In Corot and Tiepolo, Mozart and Cimarosa, there
is still a real mastery of the mother-tongue. After them, the process of mutilation
begins, but no one is conscious of it because no one now can speak it
fluently. Once upon a time, Freedom and Necessity were identical; but now
what is understood by freedom is in fact indiscipline. In the time of Rembrandt
or Bach the “failures” that we know only too well were quite unthinkable.
The Destiny of the form lay in the race or the school, not in the private tendencies
of the individual. Under the spell of a great tradition full achievement
is possible even to a minor artist, because the living art brings him in touch
with his task and the task with him. To-day, these artists can no longer perform
what they intend, for intellectual operations are a poor substitute for the
trained instinct that has died out. All of them have experienced this. Marées
was unable to complete any of his great schemes. Leibl could not bring himself
to let his late pictures go, and worked over them again and again to such
an extent that they became cold and hard. Cézanne and Renoir left work of
the best quality unfinished because, strive as they would, they could do no more.
Manet was exhausted after he had painted thirty pictures, and his “Shooting
of the Emperor Maximilian,” in spite of the immense care that is visible in every
item of the picture and the studies for it, hardly achieved as much as Goya
managed without effort in its prototype the “shootings of the 3rd of May.”
Bach, Haydn, Mozart and a thousand obscure musicians of the 18th Century
could rapidly turn out the most finished work as a matter of routine, but Wagner
knew full well that he could only reach the heights by concentrating all his
energy upon “getting the last ounce” out of the best moments of his artistic
endowment.</p>

<p class='c001'>Between Wagner and Manet there is a deep relationship, which is not, indeed,
obvious to everyone but which Baudelaire with his unerring flair for the
decadent detected at once. For the Impressionists, the end and the culmination
of art was the conjuring up of a world in space out of strokes and patches of
colour, and this was just what Wagner achieved with three bars. A whole
world of soul could crowd into these three bars. Colours of starry midnight,
of sweeping clouds, of autumn, of the day dawning in fear and sorrow, sudden
glimpses of sunlit distances, world-fear, impending doom, despair and its fierce
effort, hopeless hope—all these impressions which no composer before him
had thought it possible to catch, he could paint with entire distinctness in the
few tones of a motive. Here the contrast of Western music with Greek plastic
has reached its maximum. Everything merges in bodiless infinity, no longer
even does a linear melody wrestle itself clear of the vague tone-masses that in
strange surgings challenge an imaginary space. The motive comes up out of
dark terrible deeps. It is flooded for an instant by a flash of hard bright sun.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>Then, suddenly, it is so close upon us that we shrink. It laughs, it coaxes, it
threatens, and anon it vanishes into the domain of the strings, only to return
again out of endless distances, faintly modified and in the voice of a single
oboe, to pour out a fresh cornucopia of spiritual colours. Whatever this is, it
is neither painting nor music, in any sense of these words that attaches to
previous work in the strict style. Rossini was asked once what he thought
of the music of the “Huguenots”; “Music?” he replied. “I heard nothing
resembling it.” Many a time must this judgment have been passed at Athens
on the new painting of the Asiatic and Sicyonian schools, and opinions not
very different must have been current in Egyptian Thebes with regard to the
art of Cnossus and Tell-el-Amarna.</p>

<p class='c001'>All that Nietzsche says of Wagner is applicable, also, to Manet. Ostensibly
a return to the elemental, to Nature, as against contemplation-painting (Inhaltsmalerei)
and abstract music, their art really signifies a concession to the
barbarism of the Megalopolis, the beginning of dissolution sensibly manifested
in a mixture of brutality and refinement. As a step, it is necessarily the last
step. An artificial art has no further organic future, it is the mark of the end.</p>

<p class='c001'>And the bitter conclusion is that it is all irretrievably over with the arts of
form of the West. The crisis of the 19th Century was the death-struggle. Like
the Apollinian, the Egyptian and every other, the Faustian art dies of senility,
having actualized its inward possibilities and fulfilled its mission within the
course of its Culture.</p>

<p class='c001'>What is practised as art to-day—be it music after Wagner or painting after
Cézanne, Leibl and Menzel—is impotence and falsehood. Look where one will,
can one find the great personalities that would justify the claim that there is
still an art of determinate necessity? Look where one will, can one find the
<em>self-evidently necessary</em> task that awaits such an artist? We go through all the
exhibitions, the concerts, the theatres, and find only industrious cobblers and
noisy fools, who delight to produce something for the market, something that
will “catch on” with a public for whom art and music and drama have long
ceased to be spiritual necessities. At what a level of inward and outward
dignity stand to-day that which is called art and those who are called artists!
In the shareholders’ meeting of any limited company, or in the technical staff
of any first-rate engineering works there is more intelligence, taste, character
and capacity than in the whole music and painting of present-day Europe.
There have always been, for one great artist, a hundred superfluities who practised
art, but so long as a great tradition (and <em>therefore</em> great art) endured even
these achieved something worthy. We can forgive this hundred for existing,
for in the ensemble of the tradition they were the footing for the individual
great man. But to-day we have only these superfluities, and ten thousand of
them, working art “for a living” (as if that were a justification!). One thing
is quite certain, that to-day every single art-school could be shut down without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>art being affected in the slightest. We can learn all we wish to know about
the art-clamour which a megalopolis sets up in order to forget that its art is
dead from the Alexandria of the year 200. There, as here in our world-cities,
we find a pursuit of illusions of artistic progress, of personal peculiarity, of
“the new style,” of “unsuspected possibilities,” theoretical babble, pretentious
fashionable artists, weight-lifters with cardboard dumb-bells—the “Literary
Man” in the Poet’s place, the unabashed farce of Expressionism which the art-trade
has organized as a “phase of art-history,” thinking and feeling and forming
as industrial art. Alexandria, too, had problem-dramatists and box-office
artists whom it preferred to Sophocles, and painters who invented new tendencies
and successfully bluffed their public. What do we possess to-day as "art"?
A faked music, filled with artificial noisiness of massed instruments; a faked
painting, full of idiotic, exotic and showcard effects, that every ten years or so
concocts out of the form-wealth of millennia some new “style” which is in
fact no style at all since everyone does as he pleases; a lying plastic that steals
from Assyria, Egypt and Mexico indifferently. Yet this and only this, the taste
of the “man of the world,” can be accepted as the expression and sign of the
age; everything else, everything that “sticks to” old ideals, is for provincial
consumption.</p>

<p class='c001'>The grand Ornamentation of the past has become as truly a dead language as
Sanskrit or Church Latin.<a id='r367'></a><a href='#f367' class='c019'><sup>[367]</sup></a> Instead of its symbolism being honoured and
obeyed, its mummy, its legacies of perfected forms, are put into the pot anyhow,
and recast in wholly inorganic forms. Every modern age holds change to be
development, and puts revivals and fusions of old styles in the place of real becoming.
Alexandria also had its Pre-Raphaelite comedians with their vases,
chairs, pictures and theories, its symbolists, naturalists and expressionists.
The fashion at Rome was now Græco-Asiatic, now Græco-Egyptian, now
(after Praxiteles) neo-Attic. The relief of the XIXth Dynasty—the modern
age in the Egyptian Culture—that covered the monstrous, meaningless, inorganic
walls, statues and columns, seems like a sheer parody of the art of the
Old Kingdom. The Ptolemaic Horus-temple of Edfu is quite unsurpassed in the
way of vacuous eclecticism—so far, for we are only at the beginning of our
own development in this line, showy and assertive as the style of our streets
and squares already is.</p>

<p class='c001'>In due course, even the strength to wish for change fades out. Rameses the
Great—so soon—appropriated to himself buildings of his predecessors by
cutting out their names and inserting his own in the inscriptions. It was the
same consciousness of artistic impotence that led Constantine to adorn his
triumphal arch in Rome with sculptures taken from other buildings; but
Classical craftsmanship had set to work long before Constantine—as early,
in fact, as 150—on the business of copying old masterpieces, not because these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>were understood and appreciated in the least, but because no one was any longer
capable of producing originals. It must not be forgotten that these copyists
were the <em>artists</em> of their time; their work therefore (done in one style or another
according to the moment’s fashion) represent the maximum of creative power
then available. All the Roman portrait statues, male and female, go back for
posture and mien to a very few Hellenic types; these, copied more or less true to
style, served for torsos, while the heads were executed as “Likenesses” by
simple craftsmen who possessed the knack. The famous statue of Augustus in
armour, for example, is based on the Spearman of Polycletus, just as—to name
the first harbingers of the same phase in our own world—Lenbach rests upon
Rembrandt and Makart upon Rubens. For 1500 years (Amasis I to Cleopatra)
Egypticism piled portrait on portrait in the same way. Instead of the steady
development that the great age had pursued through the Old and Middle Kingdoms,
we find <em>fashions</em> that change according to the taste of this or that dynasty.
Amongst the discoveries at Turfan are relics of Indian dramas, contemporary
with the birth of Christ, which are similar in all respects to the Kalidasa of a
later century. Chinese painting as we know it shows not an evolution but an
up-and-down of fashions for more than a thousand years on end; and this
unsteadiness must have set in as early as the Han period. The final result is that
endless industrious repetition of a stock of fixed forms which we see to-day in
Indian, Chinese, and Arabian-Persian art. Pictures and fabrics, verses and
vessels, furniture, dramas and musical compositions—all is patternwork.<a id='r368'></a><a href='#f368' class='c019'><sup>[368]</sup></a>
We cease to be able to date anything within centuries, let alone decades,
by the language of its ornamentation. So it has been in the Last Act of all
Cultures.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>I <br> ON THE FORM OF THE SOUL</h3>

<h4 class='c021'>I</h4>

<p class='c018'>Every professed <a id='corr299.6'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='philospher'>philosopher</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_299.6'>philosopher</a></span> is forced to believe, without serious examination,
in the existence of a Something that in his opinion is capable of being handled
by the reason, for his whole spiritual existence depends on the possibility of
such a Something. For every logician and psychologist, therefore, however
sceptical he may be, there is a point at which criticism falls silent and faith
begins, a point at which even the strictest analytical thinker must cease to employ
his method—the point, namely, at which analysis is confronted with
itself and with the question of whether its problem is soluble or even exists at
all. The proposition “it is possible by thought to establish the forms of
thought” was not doubted by Kant, dubious as it may appear to the unphilosophical.
The proposition “there is a soul, the structure of which is scientifically
accessible; and that which I determine, by critical dissection of conscious
existence-acts into the form of psychic elements, functions, and complexes, <em>is</em>
my soul” is a proposition that no psychologist has doubted hitherto. And yet
it is just here that his strongest doubts should have arisen. Is an abstract science
of the spiritual possible at all? Is that which one finds on this path identical
with that which one is seeking? Why has psychology—meaning thereby not
knowledge of men and experience of life but <em>scientific</em> psychology—always been
the shallowest and most worthless of the disciplines of philosophy, a field so
empty that it has been left entirely to mediocre minds and barren systematists?
The reason is not far to seek. It is the misfortune of “experimental” psychology
that it does not even possess an <em>object</em> as the word is understood in any
and every scientific technique. Its searches and solutions are fights with
shadows and ghosts. What is it—the Soul? If the mere reason could give an
answer to that question, the science would be <span lang="la"><i>ab initio</i></span> unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of the thousands of psychologists of to-day not one can give an actual
analysis or definition of “the” Will—or of regret, anxiety, jealousy, disposition,
artistic intention. Naturally, since only the systematic can be dissected,
and we can only define notions by notions. No subtleties of intellectual play
with notional distinctions, no plausible observations of connexions between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>sensuous-corporeal states and “inward processes” touch that which is in question
here. Will—this is no notion, but a name, a prime-word like God, a sign
for something of which we have an immediate inward certainty but which we
are for ever unable to describe.</p>

<p class='c001'>We are dealing here with something eternally inaccessible to learned investigation.
It is not for nothing that every language presents a baffling complexity
of labels for the spiritual, warning us thereby that it is something not
susceptible of theoretical synthesis or systematic ordering. Here there is nothing
for us to order. Critical (i.e., literally, separating) methods apply only to
the world-as-Nature. It would be easier to break up a theme of Beethoven
with dissecting-knife or acid than to break up the soul by methods of abstract
thought. Nature-knowledge and man-knowledge have neither aims nor ways
in common. The primitive man experiences “soul,” first in other men and then
in himself, as a <span lang="la"><i>Numen</i></span>, just as he knows numina of the outer world, and develops
his impressions in mythological form. His words for these things are
symbols, sounds, not descriptive of the indescribable but indicative of it for
him who hath ears to hear. They evoke images, <em>likenesses</em> (in the sense of
Faust II)—the only language of spiritual intercourse that man has discovered
to this day. Rembrandt can reveal something of his soul, to those who are in
inward kinship with him, by way of a self-portrait or a landscape, and to
Goethe “a god gave it to say what he suffered.” Certain ineffable stirrings
of soul can be imparted by one man to the sensibility of another man through
a look, two bars of a melody, an almost imperceptible movement. That is the
real language of souls, and it remains incomprehensible to the outsider. The
word as utterance, as poetic element, may establish the link, but the word as
notion, as element of scientific prose, never.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Soul,” for the man who has advanced from mere living and feeling to the
alert and observant state, is an <em>image</em> derived from quite primary experiences of
life and death. It is as old as thought, i.e., as the articulate separation of
thinking (thinking-over) from seeing. We <em>see</em> the world around us, and since
every free-moving being must for its own safety understand that world, the
accumulating daily detail of technical and empirical experience becomes a
stock of permanent data which man, as soon as he is proficient in speech, collects
into an <em>image</em> of what he <em>understands</em>. This is the World-as-Nature.<a id='r369'></a><a href='#f369' class='c019'><sup>[369]</sup></a> What
is not environment we do not see, but we do divine “its” presence in ourselves
and in others, and by virtue of “its” physiognomic impressive power it evokes
in us the anxiety and the desire to know; and thus arises the meditated or
pondered <em>image of a counterworld</em> which is our mode of visualizing that which
remains eternally alien to the physical eye. The image of the soul is mythic
and remains objective in the field of spiritual religion so long as the image of
Nature is contemplated in the spirit of religion; and it transforms itself into a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>scientific notion and becomes objective in the field of scientific criticism as soon
as “Nature” comes to be observed critically. As “Time” is a counter-concept<a id='r370'></a><a href='#f370' class='c019'><sup>[370]</sup></a>
to space, so the “soul” is a counterworld to “Nature” and therefore variable
in dependence upon the notion of Nature as this stands from moment to moment.
It has been shown how “Time” arose, out of the feeling of the direction-quality
possessed by ever-mobile Life, as a conceptual <em>negative</em> to a positive
magnitude, as an incarnation of <em>that which is not extension</em>; and that all the
“properties” of Time, by the cool analysis of which the philosophers believe
they can solve the problem of Time, have been gradually formed and ordered
in the intellect as inverses to the properties of space. In exactly the same way,
the notion of the spiritual has come into being as the inverse and <em>negative of the
notion of the world</em>, the spatial notion of polarity assisting ("outward"-“inward”)
and the terms being suitably transvalued. <em>Every psychology is a counter-physics.</em></p>

<p class='c001'>To attempt to get an “exact” science out of the ever-mysterious soul is
futile. But the late-period City must needs have abstract thinking and it
forces the “physicist of the inner world” to elucidate a fictitious world by
ever more fictions, notions by more notions. He transmutes the non-extended
into the extended, builds up a system as “cause” for something that is only
manifested physiognomically, and comes to believe that in this system he has
the structure of “the” soul before his eyes. But the very words that he selects,
in all the Cultures, to notify to others the results of his intellectual labours
betray him. He talks of functions, feeling-complexes, mainsprings, thresholds
of consciousness; course, breadth, intensity and parallelism in spiritual processes.
All these are words proper to the mode of representation that Natural
Science employs. “The Will is related to objects” is a spatial image pure
and simple. “Conscious” and “unconscious” are only too obviously derivatives
of “above-ground” and “below-ground.” In modern theories of the
Will we meet with all the vocabulary of electro-dynamics. Will-functions
and thought-functions are spoken of in just the same way as the function
of a system of forces. To analyse a feeling means to set up a representative
silhouette in its place and then to treat this silhouette mathematically and
by definition, partition, and measurement. All soul-examination of this stamp,
however remarkable as a study of cerebral anatomy, is penetrated with the
mechanical notion of locality, and works without knowing it under imaginary
co-ordinates in an imaginary space. The “pure” psychologist is quite
unaware that he is copying the physicist, but it is not at all surprising that
the naïvest methods of experimental psychology give depressingly orthodox
results. Brain-paths and association-threads, as modes of representation,
conform entirely to an optical scheme—the “course” of the will or the
feeling; both deal with cognate <em>spatial</em> phantoms. It does not make much difference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>whether I define some psychic capacity conceptually or the corresponding
brain-region graphically. Scientific psychology has worked out for itself
a complete system of images, in which it moves with entire conviction. Every
individual pronouncement of every individual psychologist proves on examination
to be merely a variation of this system conformable to the style of outer-world
science of the day.</p>

<p class='c001'>Clear thought, emancipated from all connexion with seeing, presupposes
as its organ a culture-language, which is created by the soul of the Culture as
a part supporting other parts of its expression;<a id='r371'></a><a href='#f371' class='c019'><sup>[371]</sup></a> and presently this language
itself creates a “Nature” of word-meanings, a linguistic cosmos within which
abstract notions, judgments and conclusions—representations of number,
causality, motion—can lead a mechanically determinate existence. At any
particular time, therefore, the current image of the soul is a function of the
<em>current language and its inner symbolism</em>. All the Western, Faustian, languages
possess the notion of Will. This mythical entity manifested itself, simultaneously
in all, in that transformation of the verb<a id='r372'></a><a href='#f372' class='c019'><sup>[372]</sup></a> which decisively differentiated
our tongues from the Classical tongues and therefore our soul from the Classical
soul. When <span lang="la">“ego habeo factum”</span> replaced “feci,” a new numen of the inner
world spoke. And at the same time, under specific label, there appeared in the
scientific soul-pictures of all the Western psychologies the figure of the Will,
of a well-rounded capacity of which the definition may be formulated in different
ways by different schools, but the existence is unquestionable.</p>

<h4 class='c026'>II</h4>

<p class='c018'>I maintain, then, that scientific psychology (and, it may be added, the
psychology of the same kind that we all unconsciously practise when we try
to “figure to ourselves” the stirrings of our own or others’ souls) has, in its
inability to discover or even to approach the <a id='corr302.27'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='essense'>essence</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_302.27'>essence</a></span> of the soul, simply added
one more to the symbols that collectively make up the Macrocosm of the
culture-man. Like everything else that is no longer becoming but become, it
has put a <em>mechanism</em> in place of an <em>organism</em>. We miss in its picture that which
fills our feeling of life (and should surely be “soul” if anything is) the Destiny-quality,
the necessary directedness of existence, the possibility that life in its
course actualizes. I do not believe that the word “Destiny” figures in any
psychological system whatsoever—and we know that nothing in the world
could be more remote from actual life-experience and knowledge of men than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>a system without such elements. Associations, apperceptions, affections, motives,
thought, feeling, will—all are dead mechanisms, the mere topography
of which constitutes the insignificant total of our “soul-science.” One looked
for Life and one found an ornamental pattern of notions. And the soul remained
what it was, something that could neither be thought nor represented,
<em>the</em> secret, <em>the</em> ever-becoming, <em>the</em> pure experience.</p>

<p class='c001'>This <em>imaginary soul-body</em> (let it be called so outright for the first time) is
never anything but the exact mirror-image of the form in which the matured
culture-man looks on his outer world. In the one as in the other, the depth-experience
actualizes the extension-world.<a id='r373'></a><a href='#f373' class='c019'><sup>[373]</sup></a> Alike out of the perception of the
outside and the conception of the inside, the secret that is hinted at in the
root-word Time creates Space. The soul-image like the world-image has its
directional depth, its horizon, and its boundedness or its unboundedness. An
“inner eye” sees, an “inner ear” hears. There exists a distinct idea of
an inner order, and this inner order like the outer wears the badge of <em>causal
necessity</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>This being so, everything that has been said in this work regarding the
phenomenon of the high Cultures combines to demand an immensely wider
and richer sort of soul-study than anything worked upon so far. For everything
that our present-day psychologist has to tell us—and here we refer not only to
the systematic science but also in the wider sense to the physiognomic knowledge
of men—relates to the <em>present</em> condition of the <em>Western</em> soul, and not, as
hitherto gratuitously assumed, to “the human soul” at large.</p>

<p class='c001'>A soul-image is never anything but the image of one quite definite soul.
No observer can ever step outside the conditions and the limitations of his
time and circle, and whatever it may be that he “knows” or “cognizes,” the
very cognition itself involves in all cases choice, direction and inner form, and
is therefore <span lang="la"><i>ab initio</i></span> an expression of his proper soul. The primitive himself
appropriates a soul-image out of facts of <em>his own</em> life as subjected to the formative
working of the basic experiences of waking consciousness (distinction
of ego and world, of ego and tu) and those of being (distinction of body and
soul, sense-life and reflection, sex-life and sentiment). And as it is thoughtful
men who think upon these matters, an inner numen (Spirit, Logos, Ka, Ruach)
always arises as an opposite to the rest. But the dispositions and relations of
this numen in the individual case, and the conception that is formed of the
spiritual elements—layers of forces or substances, unity or polarity or plurality—mark
the thinker from the outset as a part of his own specific Culture.
When, therefore, one convinces one’s self that one knows the soul of an alien
Culture from its workings in actuality, the soul-image underlying the knowledge
is really <i>one’s own</i> soul-image. In this wise new experiences are readily
assimilated into the system that is already there, and it is not surprising
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>that in the end one comes to believe that one has discovered forms of eternal
validity.</p>

<p class='c001'>In reality, every Culture possesses its own systematic psychology just as it
possesses its own style of knowledge of men and experience of life; and just as
even each separate stage—the age of Scholasticism, that of the Sophists, that
of Enlightenment—forms special ideas of number and thought and Nature
that pertain to itself only, so even each separate century mirrors itself in a soul-image
of its own. The best judge of men in the Western world goes wrong
when he tries to understand a Japanese, and vice versa. But the man of learning
goes equally wrong when he tries to translate basic words of Arabic or
Greek by basic words of his own tongue. “Nephesh” is not “animus” and
“âtmân” is not “soul,” and what we consistently discover under our label
“will” Classical man did not find in his soul-picture <em>at all</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Taking one thing with another, it is no longer possible to doubt the immense
importance of the individual soul-images that have severally arisen in the
general history of thought. Classical, Apollinian man, the man of Euclidean
point-formed being, looked upon his soul as a Cosmos ordered in a group of
excellent parts. Plato called it νοῦς, θυμός, ἐπιθυμία and compared it with man,
beast and plant, in one place even with Southern, Northern and Hellenic man.
What seems to be copied here is Nature as seen by the Classical age, a well-ordered
sum of tangible things, in contrast to a space that was felt as the non-existent,
the Nonent. Where in this field is "Will"? or the idea of functional
connexions? or the other creations of <em>our</em> psychology? Do we really believe
that Plato and Aristotle were less sure in analysis than we are, and did not see
what is insistently obvious to every layman amongst us? Or is it that Will is
missing here for the same reason as space is missing in the Classical mathematic
and force in the Classical physics?</p>

<p class='c001'>Take, on the contrary, any Western psychology that you please, and you
will always find a <em>functional</em> and never a <em>bodily</em> ordering. The basic form of all
impressions which we receive from within is <i>y</i> = <i>f</i>(<i>x</i>), and that, <em>because</em> the function
is the basis of our outer world. Thinking, feeling, willing—no Western
psychologist can step outside this trinity, however much he may desire to do
so; even in the controversies of Gothic thinkers concerning the primacy of
will or reason it already emerges that the question is one of a relation between
<em>forces</em>. It matters not at all whether these old philosophers put forward their
theories as original or read them into Augustine or Aristotle. Associations,
apperceptions, will-processes, call them what you will, the elements of our
picture are without exception of the type of the mathematico-physical Function,
and in very form radically un-Classical. Now, such psychology examines
the soul, not physiognomically to indicate its traits, but physically, as an
object, to ascertain its elements, and it is quite natural therefore to find psychology
reduced to perplexity when confronted with the problem of motion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>Classical man, too, had his inward <em>Eleatic</em> difficulty,<a id='r374'></a><a href='#f374' class='c019'><sup>[374]</sup></a> and the inability of the
Schoolmen to agree as to the primacy of Will or Reason foreshadows the
dangerous flaw in Baroque physics—its inability to reach an unchallengeable
statement of the relation between force and movement. Directional energy,
denied in the Classical and also in the Indian soul-image (where all is settled
and rounded), is emphatically affirmed in the Faustian and in the Egyptian
(wherein all is systems and centres of forces); and yet, precisely because this
affirmation cannot but involve the element of time, thought, which is alien
to Time, finds itself committed to self-contradictions.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Faustian and the Apollinian images of the soul are in blunt opposition.
Once more all the old contrasts crop up. In the Apollinian we have, so to call
it, the soul-body, in the Faustian the soul-space, as the imagination-unit. The
body possesses parts, while the space is the scene of processes. Classical man
conceives of his inner world plastically. Even Homer’s idiom betrays it;
echoing, we may well believe, immemorial temple-traditions, he shows us, for
instance, the dead in Hades as well-recognizable copies of the bodies that had
been. The Pre-Socratic philosophy, with its three well-ordered parts λογιστικόν,
ἐπιθυμητικόν, θυμοειδές, suggests at once the Laocoön group. In our case the
impress is a musical one; the sonata of the inner life has the will as first
subject, thought and feeling as themes of the second subject; the movement
is bound by the strict rules of a spiritual counterpoint, and psychology’s
business is to discover this counterpoint. The simplest elements fall into antithesis
like Classical and Western number—on the one hand magnitudes,
on the other spiritual relations—and the <em>spiritual static</em> of Apollinian existence,
the stereometric ideal of σωφροσύνη and ἀταραξία, stands opposed to the
<em>soul-dynamic</em> of Faustian.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Apollinian soul-image—Plato’s biga-team with νοῦς as charioteer—takes
to flight at once on the approach of the Magian soul. It is fading out
already in the later Stoa, where the principal teachers came predominantly from
the Aramaic East, and by the time of the Early Roman Empire, even in the
literature of the city itself, it has come to be a mere reminiscence.</p>

<p class='c001'>The hall-mark of the Magian soul-image is a strict <em>dualism of two mysterious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>substances, Spirit and Soul</em>. Between these two there is neither the Classical
(static) nor the Western (functional) relation, but an altogether differently
constituted relation which we are obliged to call merely “Magian” for want
of a more helpful term, though we may illustrate it by contrasting the physics
of Democritus and the physics of Galileo with Alchemy and the Philosopher’s
Stone. On this specifically Middle-Eastern soul-image rests, of inward
necessity, all the psychology and particularly the theology with which the
“Gothic” springtime of the Arabian Culture (0-300 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>) is filled. The Gospel
of St. John belongs thereto, and the writings of the Gnostics, the Early Fathers,
the Neoplatonists, the Manichæans, and the dogmatic texts in the Talmud and
the Avesta; so, too, does the tired spirit of the Imperium Romanum, now
expressed only in religiosity and drawing the little life that is in its philosophy
from the young East, Syria, and Persia. Even in the 1st Century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> the great
Posidonius, a true Semite and young-Arabian in spite of the Classical dress
of his immense learning, was inwardly sensible of the complete opposition
between the Classical life-feeling and this Magian soul-structure which for
him was the true one. There is a patent difference of <em>value</em> between a Substance
permeating the body and a Substance which falls from the world-cavern into
humanity, abstract and divine, making of all participants a Consensus.<a id='r375'></a><a href='#f375' class='c019'><sup>[375]</sup></a> This
“Spirit” it is which evokes the higher world, and through this creation triumphs
over mere life, “the flesh” and Nature. This is the prime image that
underlies all feeling of ego. Sometimes it is seen in religious, sometimes in
philosophical, sometimes in artistic guise. Consider the portraits of the Constantinian
age, with their fixed stare into the infinite—<em>that look stands for the</em>
πνεῦμα. It is felt by Plotinus and by Origen. Paul distinguishes, for example
in I Cor., xv, 44, between σῶμα ψυχικόν and σῶμα πνευματικόν. The conception
of a double, bodily or spiritual, ecstasy and of the partition of men into
lower and higher, psychics and pneumatics, was familiar currency amongst
the Gnostics. Late-Classical literature (Plutarch) is full of the dualistic psychology
of νοῦς and ψυχή, derived from Oriental sources. It was very soon
brought into correlation with the contrast between Christian and Heathen and
that between Spirit and Nature, and it issued in that scheme of world-history
as man’s drama from Creation to Last Judgment (with an intervention of God
as means) which is common to Gnostics, Christians, Persians and Jews alike,
and has not even now been altogether overcome.</p>

<p class='c001'>This Magian soul-image received its rigorously scientific completion in the
schools of Baghdad and Basra.<a id='r376'></a><a href='#f376' class='c019'><sup>[376]</sup></a> Alfarabi and Alkindi dealt thoroughly with
the problems of this Magian psychology, which to us are tangled and largely
inaccessible. And we must by no means underrate its influence upon the young
and wholly abstract soul-theory (<em>as distinct from the ego-feeling</em>) of the West.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>Scholastic and Mystic philosophy, no less than Gothic art, drew upon Moorish
Spain, Sicily and the East for many of its forms. It must not be forgotten that
the Arabian Culture is the culture of the established revelation-religions, all
of which assume a dualistic soul-image. The Kabbala<a id='r377'></a><a href='#f377' class='c019'><sup>[377]</sup></a> and the part played
by Jewish philosophers in the so-called mediæval philosophy—i.e., late-Arabian
followed by early-Gothic—is well known. But I will only refer here
to the remarkable and little-appreciated Spinoza.<a id='r378'></a><a href='#f378' class='c019'><sup>[378]</sup></a> Child of the Ghetto, he is,
with his contemporary Schirazi, the last belated representative of the Magian,
a stranger in the form-world of the Faustian feeling. As a prudent pupil of the
Baroque he contrived to clothe his system in the colours of Western thought,
but at bottom he stands entirely under the aspect of the Arabian dualism of
two soul-substances. <em>And this is the true and inward reason why he lacked the force-concept
of Galileo and Descartes.</em> This concept is the centre of gravity of a dynamic
universe and <span lang="la"><i>ipso facto</i></span> is alien to the Magian world-feeling. There is no link
between the idea of the Philosopher’s Stone (which is implicit in Spinoza’s
idea of Deity as <span lang="la">“causa sui”</span>) and the causal necessity of <i>our</i> <a id='corr307.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Nature-picture'>Nature-picture.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_307.16'>Nature-picture.</a></span>
Consequently, his determinism is precisely that which the orthodox wisdom
of Baghdad had maintained—“Kismet.” It was there that the home of the
<span lang="it"><i>more geometrico</i></span><a id='r379'></a><a href='#f379' class='c019'><sup>[379]</sup></a> method was to be looked for—it is common to the Talmud,
the Zend Avesta and the Arabian Kalaam;<a id='r380'></a><a href='#f380' class='c019'><sup>[380]</sup></a> but its appearance in Spinoza’s
“Ethics” is a grotesque freak in <em>our</em> philosophy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Once more this Magian soul-image was to be conjured up, for a moment.
German Romanticism found in magic and the tangled thought-threads of
Gothic philosophers the same attractiveness as it found in the Crusade-ideals
of cloisters and castles, and even more in Saracenic art and poetry—without
of course understanding very much of these remote things. Schelling, Oken,
Baader, Görres and their circle indulged in barren speculations in the Arabic-Jewish
style, which they felt with evident self-satisfaction to be “dark” and
“deep”—precisely what, for Orientals, they were <em>not</em>—understanding them
but partially themselves and hoping for similar quasi-incomprehension in their
audiences. The only noteworthy point in the episode is the attractiveness of
obscurity. We may venture the conclusion that the clearest and most accessible
conceptions of Faustian thought—as we have it, for instance, in Descartes
or in Kant’s “Prolegomena”—would in the same way have been regarded
by an Arabian student as nebulous and abstruse. What for us is true, for them
is false, and vice versa; and this is valid for the soul-images of the different
Cultures as it is for every other product of their scientific thinking.</p>

<p class='c018'>The separation of its ultimate elements is a task that the Gothic world-outlook
and its philosophy leaves to the courage of the future. Just as the
ornamentation of the cathedral and the primitive contemporary painting still
shirk the decision between gold and wide atmosphere in backgrounds—between
the Magian and the Faustian aspects of God in Nature—so this early,
timid, immature soul-image as it presents itself in this philosophy mingles
characters derived from the Christian-Arabian metaphysic and its dualism of
Spirit and Soul with Northern inklings of functional soul-forces not yet avowed.
This is the discrepance that underlies the conflict concerning the primacy of
will or reason, the <em>basic problem of the Gothic philosophy</em>, which men tried to
solve now in the old Arabian, now in the new Western sense. It is this myth
of the mind—which under ever-changing guises accompanies our philosophy
throughout its course—that distinguishes it so sharply from every other. The
rationalism of late Baroque, in all the pride of the self-assured city-spirit,
decided in favour of the greater power of the Goddess Reason (Kant, the Jacobins);
but almost immediately thereafter the 19th Century (Nietzsche above
all) went back to the stronger formula <span lang="la"><i>Voluntas superior intellectu</i></span>, and this
indeed is in the blood of all of us.<a id='r381'></a><a href='#f381' class='c019'><sup>[381]</sup></a> Schopenhauer, the last of the great systematists,
has brought it down to the formula “World as Will and Idea,” and it is
only his ethic and not his metaphysic that decides <em>against</em> the Will.</p>

<p class='c001'>Here we begin to see by direct light the deep foundations and meaning of
philosophizing within a Culture. For what we see here is the Faustian soul
trying in labour of many centuries to paint a <em>self-portrait</em>, and one, moreover,
that is in intimate concordance with its world-portrait. The Gothic world-view
with its struggle of will and reason is in fact an expression of the life-feeling
of the men of the Crusades, of the Hohenstaufen empire, of the great
cathedrals. <em>These men saw the soul thus, because they were thus.</em></p>

<p class='c001'><em>Will and thought in the soul-image correspond to Direction and Extension, History
and Nature, Destiny and Causality in the image of the outer world.</em> Both aspects of
our basic characters emerge in our prime-symbol which is infinite extension.
Will links the future to the present, thought the unlimited to the here. <em>The
historic future is distance-becoming, the boundless world-horizon distance-become</em>—this
is the meaning of the Faustian depth-experience. The direction-feeling
as “Will” and the space-feeling as “Reason” are imagined as entities, almost
as legend-figures; and out of them comes the picture that our psychologists
of necessity abstract from the inner life.</p>

<p class='c001'>To call the Faustian Culture a <em>Will-Culture</em> is only another way of expressing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>the eminently historical disposition of its soul. Our first-person idiom, our
<span lang="la">“ego habeo factum”</span>—our dynamic syntax, that is—faithfully renders the
“way of doing things” that results from this disposition and, with its positive
directional energy, dominates not only our picture of the World-as-History but
our own history to boot. This first person towers up in the Gothic architecture;
the spire is an “I,” the flying buttress is an “I.” And therefore the
<em>entire Faustian ethic</em>, from Thomas Aquinas to Kant, <i>is an “excelsior”</i>—fulfilment
of an “I,” ethical work upon an “I,” justification of an “I” by faith
and works; respect of the neighbour “Thou” for the sake of one’s “I” and
its happiness; and, lastly and supremely, immortality of the “I.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Now this, precisely this, the genuine Russian regards as contemptible vain-glory.
The Russian soul, will-less, having the limitless <em>plane</em> as its prime-symbol,<a id='r382'></a><a href='#f382' class='c019'><sup>[382]</sup></a>
seeks to grow up—serving, anonymous, self-oblivious—in the
brother-world of the plane. To take “I” as the starting-point of relations
with the neighbour, to elevate “I” morally through “I’s” love of near and
dear, to repent for “I’s” own sake, are to him traits of Western vanity as
presumptuous as is the upthrusting challenge to heaven of our cathedrals that
he compares with his plane church-roof and its sprinkling of cupolas. Tolstoi’s
hero Nechludov looks after his moral “I” as he does after his finger-nails;
this is just what betrays Tolstoi as belonging to the pseudomorphosis of Petrinism.
But Raskolnikov is only something in a “we.” His fault is the fault of
all,<a id='r383'></a><a href='#f383' class='c019'><sup>[383]</sup></a> and even to regard his sin as special to himself is pride and vanity. Something
of the kind underlies the Magian soul-image also. “If any man come
to me,” says Jesus (Luke xiv, 26), “and hate not his father and mother, and
wife, and children, and brethren, <em>yea, and his own life</em> (τὴν ἑαυτοῦ ψυχήν) <em>also</em>,<a id='r384'></a><a href='#f384' class='c019'><sup>[384]</sup></a>
he cannot be my disciple”; and it is the same feeling that makes him call
himself by the title that we mistranslate “Son of Man.”<a id='r385'></a><a href='#f385' class='c019'><sup>[385]</sup></a> The Consensus of
the Orthodox too is impersonal and condemns “I” as a sin. So too with the—truly
Russian—conception of truth as the anonymous agreement of the elect.</p>

<p class='c001'>Classical man, belonging wholly to the present, is equally without that directional
energy by which our images of world and of soul are dominated, which
sums all our sense-impressions as a path towards distance and our inward experiences
as a feeling of future. He is will-less. The Classical idea of destiny and
the symbol of the Doric column leave no doubt as to that. And the contest of
thinking and willing that is the hidden theme of every serious portrait from
Jan van Eyck to Marées is impossible in Classical portraiture, for in the Classical
soul-image thought (νοῦς), the inner Zeus, is accompanied by the wholly
ahistoric entities of animal and vegetative impulse (θυμός and ἐπιθυμία),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>wholly somatic and wholly destitute of conscious direction and drive towards
an end.</p>

<p class='c001'>The actual designation of the Faustian principle, which belongs to us and to
us alone, is a matter of indifference. A name is in itself mere sound. Space,
too, is a word that is capable of being employed with a thousand nuances—by
mathematicians and philosophers, poets and painters—to express one and the
same indescribable; a word that is ostensibly common to all mankind and yet,
carrying a metaphysical under-meaning that we gave it and could not but
give it, is in that sense valid only for our Culture. It is not the notion of
“Will,” but the circumstance that we possess it while the Greeks <em>were entirely
ignorant of it</em>, that gives it high symbolic import. At the very bottom, there is
no distinction between space-as-depth and will. For the one, and <em>therefore</em> for
the other also, the Classical languages had no expression.<a id='r386'></a><a href='#f386' class='c019'><sup>[386]</sup></a> The pure space of
the Faustian world-picture is not mere extension, but efficient extension into
the distance, as an overcoming of the merely sensuous, as a strain and tendency,
as a spiritual will-to-power. I am fully aware how inadequate these periphrases
are. It is entirely impossible to indicate in exact terms the difference
between what we and what the men of the Indian or the Arabian Culture call
space, or feel or imagine in the word. But that there <em>is</em> some radical distinction
is proved by the very different fundamentals of the respective mathematics,
arts of form, and, above all, immediate utterances of <em>life</em>. We shall see how the
identity of space and will comes to expression in the acts of Copernicus and
Columbus—as well as in those of the Hohenstaufen and Napoleon—but it
underlies also, in another way, the physical notions of fields of force and
potential, ideas that it would be impossible to convey to the comprehension of
any Greek. "Space as <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> form of perception," the formula in which Kant
finally enunciated that for which Baroque philosophy had so long and tirelessly
striven, implies an assertion of supremacy of soul over the alien; the ego,
through the form, is to rule the world.<a id='r387'></a><a href='#f387' class='c019'><sup>[387]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span><em>This</em> is brought to expression in the depth-perspective of oil-painting which
makes the space-field of the picture, conceived as infinite, dependent on the
observer, who in choosing his distance asserts his dominion. It is this attraction
of distance that produces the type of the <em>heroic and historically-felt</em> landscape
that we have alike in the picture and the park of the Baroque period,
and that is expressed also in the mathematico-physical concept of the vector.
For centuries painting fought passionately to reach this symbol, which contains
all that the words space, will and force are capable of indicating. And
correspondingly we find in our metaphysic the steady tendency to formulate
pairs of concepts (such as phenomena and things-in-themselves, will and idea,
ego and non-ego) all of the same purely dynamic content, and—in utter
contrast to Protagoras’s conception of man as the measure, not the creator,
of things—to establish a functional dependence of things upon spirit. The
Classical metaphysic regarded man as a body among bodies, and knowledge
as a sort of <em>contact</em>, passing from the known to the knower and not vice versa.
The optical theories of Anaxagoras and Democritus were far from admitting
any active participation of the percipient in sense-perception. Plato never felt,
as Kant was driven to feel, the ego as centre of a transcendent sphere of effect.
The captives in his celebrated cave are really captives, the <em>slaves</em> and not the
masters of outer impressions—recipients of light from the common sun and
not themselves suns which irradiate the universe.</p>

<p class='c001'>The relation of our will to our imaginary space is evidenced again in the
physical concept of space-energy—that utterly un-Classical idea in which
even <em>spatial interval</em> figures as a form, and indeed as prime form thereof, for the
notions of “capacity” and “intensity” rest upon it. We feel will and space,
the dynamic world-picture of Galileo and Newton and the dynamic soul-picture
which has will as its centre of gravity and centre of reference, as of identical
significance. Both are Baroque ideas, symbols of the fully-ripened Faustian
Culture.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is wrong, though it may be usual, to regard the cult of the “will” as
common, if not to mankind, at any rate to Christendom, and derived in consequence
from the Early-Arabian ethos. The connexion is merely a phenomenon
of the historical surface, and the deduction fails because it confuses
the (formal) history of words and ideas such as <span lang="la">“voluntas”</span> with the course
of their destiny, thereby missing the profoundly symbolical changes of connotation
that occur in that course. When Arabian psychologists—Murtada
for instance—discuss the possibility of several “wills,” a will that hangs
together with the act, another will that independently precedes the act, another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>that has no relation to the act at all, a will that is simply the parent of a
willing, they are obviously working in deeper connotations of the Arabic
word and on the basis of a soul-image that in structure differs entirely from
the Faustian.</p>

<p class='c001'>For every man, whatever the Culture to which he belongs, the elements of
the soul are the deities of an <em>inner mythology</em>. What Zeus was for the outer
Olympus, νοῦς was for the inner world that every Greek was entirely conscious
of possessing—the throned lord of the other soul-elements. What
“God” is for us, God as Breadth of the world, the Universal Power, the ever-present
doer and provider, that also—reflected from the space of world into
the imaginary space of soul and necessarily felt as an actual presence—is
“Will.” With the microcosmic dualism of the Magian Culture, with <em>ruach</em> and
<em>nephesh</em>, pneuma and psyche, is necessarily associated the macrocosmic opposition
of God and Devil—Ormuzd and Ahriman for Persians, Yahwe and
Beelzebub for Jews, Allah and Eblis for Mohammedans—in brief, Absolute
Good and Absolute Evil. And note, further, how in the Western world-feeling
<em>both</em> these oppositions pale <em>together</em>. In proportion as the Will emerges, out of
the Gothic struggle for primacy between <span lang="la">“intellectus”</span> and <span lang="la">“voluntas,”</span> as
the <em>centre of a spiritual monotheism</em>, the figure of the Devil fades out of the real
world. In the Baroque age the pantheism of the outer world immediately
resulted in one of the inner world also; and the word “God” in antithesis to
“world” has always—however interpreted in this or that case—implied
exactly what is implied in the word “will” with respect to soul, viz., the
power that moves all that is within its domain.<a id='r388'></a><a href='#f388' class='c019'><sup>[388]</sup></a> Thought no sooner leaves
Religion for Science than we get the double myth of concepts, in physics and
psychology. The concepts “force,” “mass,” “will,” “passion” rest not on
objective experience but on a life-feeling. Darwinism is nothing but a specially
shallow formulation of this feeling. No Greek would have used the word
“Nature” as our biology employs it, in the sense of an absolute and methodical
activity. “The will of God” for us is a pleonasm—God (or “Nature,” as
some say) is nothing but will. After the Renaissance the notion of God sheds
the old sensuous and personal traits (omnipresence and omnipotence are almost
mathematical concepts), becomes little by little identical with the notion of
infinite space and in becoming so becomes transcendent world-will. And <em>therefore</em>
it is that about 1700 painting has to yield to instrumental music—the
only art that in the end is capable of clearly expressing what we feel about God.
Consider, in contrast with this, the gods of Homer. Zeus emphatically does
<em>not</em> possess full powers over the world, but is simply <span lang="la">“primus inter pares,”</span> a
body amongst bodies, as the Apollinian world-feeling requires. Blind necessity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>the Ananke immanent in the cosmos of Classical consciousness, is in no sense
dependent upon him; on the contrary, the Gods are subordinate to It. Æschylus
says so outright in a powerful passage of the “Prometheus,”<a id='r389'></a><a href='#f389' class='c019'><sup>[389]</sup></a> but it is perceptible
enough even in Homer, e.g., in the Strife of the Gods and in that
decisive passage in which Zeus takes up the scales of destiny, not to settle, but
to learn, the fate of Hector.<a id='r390'></a><a href='#f390' class='c019'><sup>[390]</sup></a> The Classical soul, therefore, with its parts and
its properties, imagines itself as an Olympus of little gods, and to keep these
at peace and in harmony with one another is the ideal of the Greek life-ethic
of σωφροσύνη and ἀταραξία. More than one of the philosophers betrays the
connexion by calling νοῦς, the highest part of the soul, Zeus. Aristotle assigns
to his deity the single function of θεωρία, contemplation, and this is
Diogenes’s ideal also—a completely-matured static of life in contrast to the
equally ripe dynamic of our 18th-Century ideal.</p>

<p class='c001'>The enigmatic Something in the soul-image that is called “will,” the <em>passion
of the third dimension</em>, is therefore quite specially a creation of the Baroque, like
the perspective of oil-painting and the force-idea of modern physics and the
tone-world of instrumental music. In every case the Gothic had foreshadowed
what these intellectualizing centuries brought to fullness. Here, where we are
trying to take in the <em>cast</em> of Faustian life in contradiction to that of all other
lives, what we have to do is to keep a firm hold on the fact that the primary
words will, space, force, God, upborne by and permeated with connotations
of <em>Faustian</em> feeling, are emblems, are the effective framework that sustains the
great and kindred form-worlds in which this being expresses itself. It has been
believed, hitherto, that in these matters one was holding in one’s grip a body
of eternal facts, of facts-in-themselves, which sooner or later would be successfully
treated, “known,” and proved by the methods of critical research.
This illusion of natural science was shared by psychology also. But the view
that these “universally-valid” fundamentals belong merely <em>to the Baroque style of
apprehension and comprehension</em>, that as expression-forms they are only of transitory
significance, and that they are only “true” for the Western type of
intellect, alters the whole meaning of those sciences and leads us to look upon
them not only as subjects of systematic cognition but also, and in a far higher
degree, as <em>objects of physiognomic study</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Baroque architecture began, as we have seen, when Michelangelo replaced
the tectonic elements of the Renaissance, support and load, by those of dynamics,
force and mass. While Brunelleschi’s chapel of the Pazzi in Florence
expresses a bright composedness, Vignola’s façade of the Gesù in Rome is <em>will
become stone</em>. The new style in its ecclesiastical form has been designated the
“Jesuit,” and indeed there is an inward connexion between the achievement of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>Vignola and Giacomo Della Porta and the creation by Ignatius Loyola of the
Order that stands for the pure and abstract will of the Church,<a id='r391'></a><a href='#f391' class='c019'><sup>[391]</sup></a> just as there is
between the invisible operations and the unlimited range of the Order and the
arts of Calculus and Fugue.</p>

<p class='c001'>Henceforward, then, the reader will not be shocked if we speak of <em>a Baroque</em>,
<em>and even of a Jesuit</em>, <em>style in psychology</em>, <em>mathematics</em>, <em>and pure physics</em>. The form-language
of dynamics, which puts the energetic contrast of capacity and intensity
in place of the volitionless somatic contrast of material and form, is one
common to all the mind-creations of those centuries.</p>

<h4 class='c026'>IV</h4>

<p class='c018'>The question is now: How far is the man of this Culture himself fulfilling
what the soul-image that he has created requires of him? If we can, to-day,
state the theme of Western physics quite generally to be efficient space, we have
<span lang="la"><i>ipso facto</i></span> defined also the kind of existence, the <em>content</em> of existence as lived by
contemporary man. We, as Faustian natures, are accustomed to take note of
the individual according to his <em>effective</em> and not according to his plastic-static
appearance in the field of our life-experience. We measure what a man is by
his activity, which may be directed inwardly or outwardly, and we judge all
intentions, reasons, powers, convictions and habits entirely by this directedness.
The word with which we sum up this aspect is <em>character</em>. We habitually
speak of the “character” of heads and landscapes; of ornaments, brush-strokes
and scripts; of whole arts and ages and Cultures. The art of the characteristic
is, above all, Baroque music—alike in respect of its melody and its instrumentation.
Here again is a word indicating an indescribable, a something that
emphasizes, among all the Cultures, the Faustian in particular. And the deep
relation between this word “character” and the word “will” is unmistakable;
what will is in the soul-image, character is in the picture of life as we see it,
the Western life that is self-evident to Western men. It is the fundamental
postulate of all our ethical systems, differ otherwise as they may in their
metaphysical or practical precepts, that man has character. Character, which
forms itself <i>in the stream of the world—the personality, the relation of living to
doing</i>—is a Faustian impression of the man made by the man; and, significantly
enough, just as in the physical world-picture it has proved impossible (in spite
of the most rigorous theoretical examination) to separate the vectorial idea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>of forces from the idea of motion (because of the inherent directional quality
of the vector), so also it is impossible to draw a strict distinction between will
and soul, character and life. At the height of our Culture, certainly since the
17th Century, we feel the word “life” as a pure and simple synonym of willing.
Expressions like living force, life-will, active energy, abound in our ethical
literature and their import is taken for granted, whereas the Age of Pericles
could not even have translated them into its language.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hitherto the pretension of each and every morale to universal validity has
obscured the fact that every Culture, as a homogeneous being of higher order,
possesses a <em>moral constitution proper to itself</em>. There are as many morales as there
are Cultures. Nietzsche was the first to have an inkling of this; but he never
came anywhere near to a really objective morphology of morale “beyond good”
(<em>all</em> good) “and evil” (<em>all</em> evil). He evaluated Classical, Indian, Christian and
Renaissance morale by his own criteria instead of understanding the style of
them as a symbol. And yet if anything could detect the <em>prime-phenomenon</em> of
Morale as such, it should have been the historical insight of a Westerner.
However, it appears that we are only now ripe enough for such a study. The
conception of mankind as an active, fighting, progressing whole is (and has
been since Joachim of Floris and the Crusades) so necessary an idea for us that
we find it hard indeed to realize that it is an exclusively Western hypothesis,
living and valid only for a season. To the Classical spirit mankind appears as
a stationary mass, and correspondingly there is that quite dissimilar morale
that we can trace from the Homeric dawn to the time of the Roman Empire.
And, more generally, we shall find that the immense activity of the Faustian
life-feeling is most nearly matched in the Chinese and the Egyptian, and the
rigorous passivity of the Classical in the Indian.</p>

<p class='c001'>If ever there was a group of nations that kept the “struggle for existence”
constantly before its eyes, it was the Classical Culture. All the cities, big and
little, fought one another to sheer extinction, without plan or purpose, without
mercy, body against body, under the stimulus of a completely anti-historical
instinct. But Greek ethics, notwithstanding Heraclitus, were far from making
struggle an ethical principle. The Stoics and the Epicureans alike preached
abstention from it as an ideal. The overcoming of resistances may far more
justly be called the typical impulse of the Western soul. Activity, determination,
self-control, are postulates. To battle against the comfortable foregrounds
of life, against the impressions of the moment, against what is near,
tangible and easy, to win through to that which has generality and duration
and links past and future—these are the sum of all Faustian imperatives
from earliest Gothic to Kant and Fichte, and far beyond them again to the
Ethos of immense power and will exhibited in our States, our economic systems
and our technics. The <span lang="la"><i>carpe diem</i></span>, the saturated being, of the Classical
standpoint is the most direct contrary of that which is felt by Goethe and Kant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>and Pascal, by Church and Freethinker, as alone possessing value—<em>active,
fighting and victorious being</em>.<a id='r392'></a><a href='#f392' class='c019'><sup>[392]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>As all the forms of Dynamic (whether pictorial, musical, physical, social
or political) are concerned with the working-out of infinite relations and deal,
not with the individual case and the sum of individual cases as the Classical
physics had done, but with the typical course or process and its functional rule,
“character” must be understood as that which remains in principle constant in
the working-out of life; where there is no such constant we speak of “lack of
character.” It is character—the form in virtue of which a <em>moving</em> existence
can combine the highest constancy in the essential with the maximum variability
in the details—that makes telling biography (such as Goethe’s <span lang="la">“Wahrheit
und Dichtung”</span>), possible at all. Plutarch’s truly Classical biographies are
by comparison mere collections of anecdotes strung together chronologically and
not ordered pictures of historical development, and it will hardly be disputed
that only this second kind of biography is imaginable in connexion with
Alcibiades or Pericles or, for that matter, any purely Apollinian figure. Their
experiences lack, not mass, but relation; there is something <em>atomic</em> about them.
Similarly in the field of Science the Greek did not merely <em>forget</em> to look for
general laws in the sum of his experiential data; in his cosmos they were simply
<em>not there to be found</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>It follows that the sciences of character-study, particularly physiognomy
and graphology, would not be able to glean much in the Classical field. Its
handwriting we do not know, but we do know that its ornament, as compared
with the Gothic, is of incredible simplicity and feebleness of character-expression—think
of the Meander and the Acanthus-shoot. On the other
hand, it has never been surpassed in timeless evenness.</p>

<p class='c001'>It goes without saying that we, when we turn to look into the Classical
life-feeling, must find there some basic element of ethical values that is antithetical
to “character” in the same way as the statue is antithetical to the
fugue. Euclidean geometry to Analysis, and body to space. We find it in the
<em>Gesture</em>. It is this that provides the necessary foundation for a spiritual static.
The word that stands in the Classical vocabulary where “personality” stands
in our own is προσῶπον, “persona”—namely <em>rôle</em> or <em>mask</em>. In late Greek or
Roman speech it means <em>the public aspect and mien</em> of a man, which for Classical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>man is tantamount to the essence and kernel of him. An orator was described
as speaking in the προσῶπον—not the character or the vein as we should say—of
a priest or a soldier. The slave was ἀπρόσωπος—that is, he had <em>no</em>
attitude or figure in the public life—but not ἀσώματος—that is, he did have
a <em>soul</em>. The idea that Destiny had assigned the rôle of king or general to a man
was expressed by Romans in the words <span lang="de"><cite>persona regis, imperatoris</cite></span>.<a id='r393'></a><a href='#f393' class='c019'><sup>[393]</sup></a> The Apollinian
cast of life is manifest enough here. What is indicated is not the personality
(that is, an unfolding of inward possibilities in <em>active striving</em>) but a
permanent and self-contained <em>posture</em> strictly adapted to a so-to-say plastic
ideal of being. It is only in the Classical ethic that Beauty plays a distinct
rôle. However labelled—as σωφροσύνη, καλοκἀγαθία or ἀταραξία—it
always amounts to the well-ordered group of tangible and publicly evident
traits, defined for other men rather than specific to one’s self. A man was the
object and not the subject of outward life. The pure present, the moment, the
foreground were not conquered but worked up. The notion of an inward life
is impossible in this connexion. The significance of Aristotle’s phrase ζῶον
πολιτίκον—quite untranslatable and habitually translated with a Western
connotation—is that it refers to men who are nothing when single and
lonely (what could be more preposterous than an Athenian Robinson
Crusoe!) and only count for anything when in a plurality, in agora or forum,
where each reflects his neighbour and thus, only thus, acquires a genuine
reality. It is all implicit in the phrase σώματα πόλεως, used for the burghers
of the city. And thus we see that the Portrait, the centre of Baroque art, is
identical with the representation of a man to the extent that he possesses character,
and that in the best age of Attic the representation of a man in respect
of his <em>attitude</em>, as <em>persona</em>, necessarily leans to the form-ideal of the nude statue.</p>

<h4 class='c026'>V</h4>

<p class='c018'>This opposition, further, has produced forms of tragedy that differ from
one another radically in every respect. The Faustian <em>character-drama</em> and
the Apollinian <em>drama of noble gesture</em> have in fact nothing but name in
common.<a id='r394'></a><a href='#f394' class='c019'><sup>[394]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Starting, significantly enough, from Seneca and not from Æschylus and
Sophocles<a id='r395'></a><a href='#f395' class='c019'><sup>[395]</sup></a> (just as the contemporary architecture linked itself with Imperial
Rome and not with Pæstum), the Baroque drama with ever-increasing emphasis
makes character instead of occurrence its centre of gravity, the origin of a
system of spiritual co-ordinates (so to express it) which gives the scenic facts
position, sense, and value in relation to itself. The outcome is a <em>tragedy of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>willing</em>, of efficient forces, of inward movement not necessarily exhibited in
visible form, whereas Sophocles’s method was to employ a minimum of happening
and to put it behind the scenes particularly by means of the artifice of
the “messenger.” The Classical tragedy relates to general situations and not
particular personalities. It is specifically described by Aristotle as μίμησίς οὐκ
<a id='corr318.6'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='ἀνθρώπῶν ἀλλὰ πράξεων'>ἀνθρώπων ἀλλὰ πρᾶξεως</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_318.6'>ἀνθρώπων ἀλλὰ πρᾶξεως</a></span> καὶ βίου. That which in his <span lang="la"><cite>Poetica</cite></span>—assuredly the
most fateful of all books for our poetry—he calls ἦθος, namely the ideal
<em>bearing</em> of the ideal Hellene in a painful situation, has as little in common with
our notion of character (viz., a constitution of the ego which determines events)
as a surface in Euclidean geometry has with the like-named concept in Riemann’s
theory of algebraic equations. It has, unfortunately, been our habit
for centuries past to translate ἦθος as “character” instead of paraphrasing it
(exact rendering is almost impossible) by “rôle,” “bearing” or “gesture”; to
reproduce myth, μῦθος, which is <em>timeless occurrence</em>, by “action”; and to derive
δρᾶμα from “doing.” It is Othello, Don Quixote, Le Misanthrope, Werther
and Hedda Gabler that are characters, and the tragedy consists in the mere
existence of human beings thus constituted in their respective <span lang="fr"><i>milieux</i></span>. Their
struggle—whether against this world or the next, or themselves—is forced
on them by their character and not by anything coming from outside; a soul
is placed in a web of contradictory relations that admits of no net solution.
Classical stage-figures, on the contrary, are rôles and not characters; over and
over again the same figures appear—the old man, the slayer, the lover, all
slow-moving bodies under masks and on stilts. Thus in Classical drama—even
of the Late period—the mask is an element of profound symbolic <em>necessity</em>,
whereas our pieces would not be regarded as played at all without the play
of features. It is no answer to point to the great size of the Greek theatre, for
even the strolling player—even the portrait-statue<a id='r396'></a><a href='#f396' class='c019'><sup>[396]</sup></a>—wore a mask, and had
there been any spiritual need of a more intimate setting the required architectural
form would have been forthcoming quickly enough.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the tragedy of a character, what <em>happens</em> is the outcome of a long inner
development. But in what <em>befalls</em> Ajax and Philoctetes, Antigone and Electra,
their psychological antecedents (even supposing them to have any) play no
part. The decisive event comes upon them, brutally, as accident, from without,
and it might have befallen another in the same way and with the same
result. It would not be necessary even for that other to be of the same sex.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not enough to distinguish Classical and Western tragedy merely as
action-drama and event-drama. Faustian tragedy is <em>biographical</em>, Classical <em>anecdotal</em>;
that is, the one deals with the sense of a whole life and the other with the
content of the single moment.<a id='r397'></a><a href='#f397' class='c019'><sup>[397]</sup></a> What relation, for instance, has the entire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span><em>inward</em> past of Œdipus or Orestes to the shattering event that suddenly meets
him on his way?<a id='r398'></a><a href='#f398' class='c019'><sup>[398]</sup></a> There is one sort of destiny, then, that strikes like a flash
of lightning, and just as blindly, and another that interweaves itself with the
course of a life, an invisible thread<a id='r399'></a><a href='#f399' class='c019'><sup>[399]</sup></a> that yet distinguishes this particular life
from all others. There is not the smallest trait in the past existence of Othello—that
masterpiece of psychological analysis—that has not some bearing on
the catastrophe. Race-hatred, the isolation of the upstart amongst the patricians,
the Moor as soldier and as child of Nature, the loneliness of the ageing
bachelor—all these things have their significance. Lear, too, and Hamlet—compare
the exposition of these characters with that of Sophoclean pieces.
They are psychological expositions through-and-through and not summations
of outward data. The psychologist, in our sense of the word, namely the fine
student (hardly nowadays to be distinguished from the poet) of spiritual turning-points,
was entirely unknown to the Greeks. They were no more analytical
in the field of soul than in that of number; <span lang="fr"><i>vis-à-vis</i></span> the Classical soul, how could
they be so? “Psychology” in fact is the proper designation for the <em>Western</em> way
of fashioning men; the word holds good for a portrait by Rembrandt as for the
music of “Tristan,” for Stendhal’s Julian Sorel as for Dante’s “Vita Nuova.”
The like of it is not to be found in any other Culture. If there is anything
that the Classical arts scrupulously exclude it is this, for psychology is the
form in which art handles man as incarnate will and not as σῶμα. To call
Euripides a psychologist is to betray ignorance of what psychology is. What
an abundance of character there is even in the mere mythology of the North
with its sly dwarfs, its lumpy giants, its teasing elves, its Loki, Baldr and the
rest! Zeus, Apollo, Poseidon, Ares are simply “men,” Hermes the “youth,”
Athene a maturer Aphrodite, and the minor gods—as the later plastic
shows—distinguishable only by the labels. And the same is true without
reservation of the figures of the Attic stage. In Wolfram von Eschenbach, Cervantes,
Shakespeare, Goethe, the tragic is individual, life develops from within
outwards, dynamic, functional, and the life-courses are only fully understandable
with reference to the historical background of the century. But in the
great tragedians of Athens it comes from outside, it is static, Euclidean. To
repeat a phrase already used in connexion with world-history, the shattering
event is <em>epochal</em> in the former and merely <em>episodic</em> in the latter, even the finale
of death being only the last bead in the string of sheer accidents that makes
up an existence.</p>

<p class='c001'>A Baroque tragedy is nothing but this same directive character brought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>into and developed in the light-world, and shown as a curve instead of as an
equation, as kinetic instead of as potential energy. The visible person is the
character as potential, the action the character at work. This, under the heap
of Classicist reminiscences and misunderstandings that still hides it, is the
whole meaning of our idea of Tragedy. The tragic man of the Classical is a
Euclidean body that is struck by the Heimarmene in a position that it did not
choose and cannot alter, but is seen, in the light that plays from without upon
its surfaces, to be indeformable <span lang="fr"><i>quand même</i></span>. This is the sense in which Agamemnon
is ναύαρχον σῶμα βασίλειον and in which Œdipus’s σῶμα is subjected
to the Oracle.<a id='r400'></a><a href='#f400' class='c019'><sup>[400]</sup></a> Down to Alexander the significant figures of Greek history
astonish us with their inelasticity; not one of them, apparently, undergoes
in the battle of life any such inward transformation as those which we know
took place in Luther and Loyola. What we are prone—too prone—to call
“characterization” in Greek drama is nothing but the reflection of events
upon the ἦθος of the hero, never the reflection of a personality on events.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of deep necessity, therefore, we Faustians understand drama as a maximum
of activity; and, of deep necessity also, the Greek understood it as a maximum
of passivity.<a id='r401'></a><a href='#f401' class='c019'><sup>[401]</sup></a> Speaking generally, the Attic tragedy had no “action” at all.
The Mysteries were purely δράματα or δρώμενα, i.e., ritual performances, and
it was from the Mystery-form with its “peripeteia” that Æschylus (himself
an Eleusinian) derived the high drama that he created. Aristotle describes
tragedy as the <em>imitation</em> of an occurrence. This imitation is identical with the
“profanation” of the mysteries; and we know that Æschylus went further
and made the sacral vestments of the Eleusinian priesthood the regular costume
of the Attic stage, and was accused on that account.<a id='r402'></a><a href='#f402' class='c019'><sup>[402]</sup></a> For the δρᾶμα proper,
with its reversal from lamentation to joy, consisted not in the fable that was
narrated but in the ritual action that lay behind it, and was understood and
felt by the spectator as deeply symbolic. With this element of the non-Homeric
early religion<a id='r403'></a><a href='#f403' class='c019'><sup>[403]</sup></a> there became associated another, a boorish—the burlesque
(whether phallic or dithyrambic) scenes of the spring festivals of Demeter and
Dionysus. The beast-dances<a id='r404'></a><a href='#f404' class='c019'><sup>[404]</sup></a> and the accompanying song were the germ of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>the tragic Chorus which puts itself before the actor or “answerer” of Thespis
(534).</p>

<p class='c001'>The genuine tragedy grew up out of the solemn death-lament (threnos,
nænia). At some time or other the joyous play of the Dionysus festival (which
also was a soul-feast) became a mourners’ chorus of men, the Satyr-play being
relegated to the end. In 494 Phrynichus produced the “Fall of Miletus”—not
a historical drama but a lament of the women of Miletus—and was
heavily fined for thus recalling the public calamity. It was Æschylus’s introduction
of the second actor that accomplished the essential of Classical
tragedy; the lament as <em>given theme</em> was thenceforward subordinated to the
visual presentation of a great human suffering as <em>present motive</em>. The foreground-story
(μύθος) is not “action” but the occasion for the songs of the Chorus,
which still constitutes the τραγῳδία proper. It is immaterial whether the
occurrence is indicated by narrative or exposition. The spectator was in solemn
mood and he felt himself and his own fate to be meant in the words of pathos.
It was in him that the περιπέτεια, the central element of the holy pageant,
took place. Whatever the environment of message and tale, the liturgical
lament for the woe of mankind remained always the centre of gravity of the
whole, as we see more particularly in the “Prometheus,” the “Agamemnon”
and the “Œdipus Rex.” But presently—at the very time when in Polycletus
the pure plastic was triumphing over the fresco<a id='r405'></a><a href='#f405' class='c019'><sup>[405]</sup></a>—there emerges high above
the lament the grandeur of human endurance, the attitude, the ἦθος of the
Hero. The theme is, not the heroic Doer whose will surges and breaks against
the resistance of alien powers or the demons in his own breast, but the will-less
Patient whose somatic existence is—gratuitously—destroyed. The Prometheus
trilogy of Æschylus begins just where Goethe would in all probability
have left off. King Lear’s madness is the <em>issue</em> of the tragic action, but Sophocles’s
Ajax is <em>made</em> mad by Athene before the drama opens—here is the
difference between a character and an operated figure. Fear and compassion,
in fact, are, as Aristotle says, the necessary effect of Greek tragedy upon the
Greek (and only the Greek) spectator, as is evident at once from his choice of
the most effective scenes, which are those of piteous crash of fortune (περιπέτεια)
and of recognition (ἀναγνώρισις). In the first, the ruling impression is φόβος
(terror) and in the second it is ἐλεός (pity), and the καθάρσις in the spectator
presupposes his existence-ideal to be that of ἀταραξία.<a id='r406'></a><a href='#f406' class='c019'><sup>[406]</sup></a> The Classical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>soul is pure “present,” pure σῶμα, unmoved and point-formed being. To
see this imperilled by the jealousy of the Gods or by that blind chance that may
crash upon any man’s head without reason and without warning, is the most
fearful of all experiences. The very roots of Greek being are struck at by what
for the challenging Faustian is the first stimulus to living activity. And then—to
find one’s self <em>delivered</em>, to see the sun come out again and the dark thunder
clouds huddle themselves away on the remote horizon, to rejoice profoundly in
the admired grand gesture, to see the tortured mythical soul breathe again—that
is the κάθαρσις. But it presupposes a kind of life-feeling that is entirely
alien to us, the very word being hardly translatable into our languages and our
sensations. It took all the æsthetic industry and assertiveness of the Baroque
and of Classicism, backed by the meekest submissiveness before ancient texts,
to persuade us that this is the spiritual basis of our own tragedy as well. And
no wonder. For the fact is that the effect of our tragedy is precisely the opposite.
It does not deliver us from deadweight pressure of events, but evokes
active dynamic elements in us, stings us, stimulates us. It awakens the primary
feelings of an energetic human being, the fierceness and the joy of tension,
danger, violent deed, victory, crime, the triumph of overcoming and destroying—feelings
that have slumbered in the depths of every Northern soul since the
days of the Vikings, the Hohenstaufen and the Crusades. <em>That</em> is Shakespearian
effect. A Greek would not have tolerated Macbeth, nor, generally, would he
have comprehended the meaning of this mighty art of directional biography at
all. That figures like Richard III, Don Juan, Faust, Michael Kohlhaas, Golo—un-Classical
from top to toe—awaken in us not sympathy but a deep and
strange envy, not fear but a mysterious desire to suffer, to suffer-with (“compassion”
of quite another sort), is visibly—even to-day when Faustian
tragedy in its final form, the German, is dead at last—the standing motive of
the literature of our Alexandrian phase. In the “sensational” adventure- and
detective-story, and still more recently in the cinema-drama (the equivalent
of the Late-Classical mimes), a relic of the unrestrainable Faustian impulse to
conquer and discover is still palpable.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are corresponding differences between the Apollinian and the Faustian
outlook in the forms of dramatic presentation, which are the complement
of the poetic idea. The antique drama is a piece of plastic, a group of pathetic
scenes conceived as reliefs, a pageant of gigantic marionettes disposed against
the definitive plane of the back-wall.<a id='r407'></a><a href='#f407' class='c019'><sup>[407]</sup></a> Presentation is entirely that of grandly-imagined
gestures, the meagre facts of the fable being solemnly recited rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>than presented. The technique of Western drama aims at just the opposite—unbroken
movement and strict exclusion of flat static moments. The famous
“three unities” of place, time and action, as unconsciously evolved (though
not expressly formulated) in Athens, are a paraphrase of the type of the Classical
marble statue and, like it, an indication of what classical man, the man
of the Polis and the pure present and the gesture, felt about life. The unities
are all, effectively, <em>negative</em>, denials of past and future, repudiation of all spiritual
action-at-a-distance. They can be summed in the one word ἀταραξία. The
postulates of these “unities” must not be confused with the superficially
similar postulates in the drama of the Romance peoples. The Spanish theatre
of the 16th Century bowed itself to the authority of “Classical” rules, but
it is easy to see the influence of <span lang="fr"><i>noblesse oblige</i></span> in this; Castilian dignity responded
to the appeal without knowing, or indeed troubling to find out, the original
sense of the rules. The great Spanish dramatists, Tirso da Molina above all,
fashioned the “unities” of the Baroque, but not as metaphysical negations,
but purely as expressions of the spirit of high courtesy, and it was as such that
Corneille, the docile pupil of Spanish “grandezza,” borrowed them. It was a
fateful step. If Florence threw herself into the imitation of the Classical sculpture—at
which everyone marvelled and of which no one possessed the final
criteria—no harm was done, for there was by then no Northern plastic to
suffer thereby. But with tragedy it was another matter. Here there was the
possibility of a mighty drama, purely Faustian, of unimagined forms and
daring. That this did <em>not</em> appear, that for all the greatness of Shakespeare the
Teutonic drama never quite shook off the spell of misunderstood convention,
was the consequence of blind faith in the authority of Aristotle. What might
not have come out of Baroque drama had it remained under the impression of
the knightly epic and the Gothic Easter-play and Mystery, in the near neighbourhood
of Oratorios and Passions, without ever hearing of the Greek theatre!
A tragedy issuing from the spirit of contrapuntal music, free of limitations
proper to plastic but here meaningless, a dramatic poetry that from Orlando
Lasso and Palestrina could develop—side by side with Heinrich Schütz, Bach,
Händel, Gluck and Beethoven, but entirely free—to a pure form of its own:
that was what was possible, and that was what did not happen; and it is only
to the fortunate circumstance that the whole of the fresco-art of Hellas has
been lost that we owe the inward freedom of our oil-painting.</p>

<h4 class='c026'>VI</h4>

<p class='c018'>The unities were not sufficient for the Attic drama. It demanded, further, the
rigid mask in lieu of facial play, thus forbidding spiritual characterization in
the same spirit as Attic sentiment forbade likeness-statuary. It demanded more-than-life-sized
figures and got them by means of the cothurnus and by padding
and draping the actor till he could scarcely move, thus eliminating all his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>individuality. Lastly, it required monotonous sing-song delivery, which it
ensured by means of a mouthpiece fixed in the mask.</p>

<p class='c001'>The bare text as we read it to-day (not without reading into it the spirit
of Goethe and Shakespeare and of our perspective vision) conveys little of the
deeper significance of these dramas. Classical art-works were created entirely
for the eye, even the physical eye, of Classical man, and the secrets reveal
themselves only when put in sensuous forms. And here our attention is drawn
to a feature of Greek tragedy that any true tragedy of the Faustian style must
find intolerable, the continual presence of the Chorus. The Chorus is the
primitive tragedy, for without it the ἦθος would be impossible. Character
one possesses for one’s self, but attitude has meaning only in relation to others.</p>

<p class='c001'>This Chorus as crowd (the ideal opposite to the lonely or inward man and
the monologue of the West), this Chorus which is always there, the witness
of every “soliloquy,” this Chorus by which, in the stage-life as in the real
life, fear before the boundless and the void is banished, is truly Apollinian.
Self-review as a <em>public</em> action, pompous public mourning in lieu of the solitary
anguish of the bedchamber, the tears and lamentations that fill a whole series
of dramas like the “Philoctetes” and the “Trachiniæ,” the impossibility of
being alone, the feeling of the Polis, all the feminine of this Culture that we
see idealized in the Belvedere Apollo, betrays itself in this symbol of the
Chorus. In comparison with this kind of drama, Shakespeare’s is a single
monologue. Even in the conversations, even in the group-scenes we are sensible
of the immense <em>inner</em> distance between the persons, each of whom at bottom
is only talking with himself. Nothing can overcome this spiritual remoteness.
It is felt in Hamlet as in “Tasso” and in Don Quixote as in Werther, but even
Wolfram von Eschenbach’s Parzeval is filled with and stamped by the sense of
infinity. The distinction holds for all Western poetry against all Classical. All
our lyric verse from Walther von der Vogelweide to Goethe and from Goethe to
the poems of our dying world-cities is monologue, while the Classical lyric is a
choral lyric, a singing before witnesses. The one is received inwardly, in wordless
reading, as soundless music, and the other is publicly recited. The one belongs
to the still chamber and is spread by means of the book, the other belongs
to the place where it is voiced.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus, although the Eleusinian Mysteries and the Thracian festival of the
epiphany of Dionysus had been nocturnal celebrations, the art of Thespis developed,
as its inmost nature required, as a scene of the morning and the full
sunlight. On the contrary, our Western popular and Passion plays, which
originated in the sermon of allocated parts and were produced first by priests
in the church, and then by laymen in the open square, on the <em>mornings</em> of high
festivals, led almost unnoticed to an art of evening and night. Already in
Shakespeare’s time performances took place in the late afternoon, and by
Goethe’s this mystical sense of a proper relation between art-work and light-setting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>had attained its object. In general, every art and every Culture has its
significant times of day. The music of the 18th Century is a music of the darkness
and the inner eye, and the plastic of Athens is an art of cloudless day.
That this is no superficial contrast we can see by comparing the Gothic plastic,
wrapped eternally in “dim religious light,” and the Ionic flute, the instrument
of high noon. The candle affirms and the sunlight denies space as the opposite
of things. At night the universe of space triumphs over matter, at midday
things and nearness assert themselves and space is repudiated. The same contrast
appears in Attic fresco and Northern oil-painting, and in the symbols of
Helios and Pan and those of the starry night and red sunset. It is at midnight,
too, and particularly in the twelve long nights after Christmas, that the souls
of our dead walk abroad. In the Classical world, the souls belong to the day—even
the early Church still speaks of the δωδεκαήμερον, the twelve dedicated
days; but with the awakening of the Faustian soul these become “Twelfth
Night.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The Classical vase-painting and fresco—though the fact has never been
remarked—has no time-of-day. No shadow indicates the state of the sun, no
heaven shows the stars. There is neither morning nor evening, neither spring
nor autumn, but <em>pure timeless brightness</em>.<a id='r408'></a><a href='#f408' class='c019'><sup>[408]</sup></a> For equally obvious reasons our oil-painting
developed in the opposite direction, towards an imaginary darkness,
also independent of time-of-day, which forms the characteristic atmosphere
of the Faustian soul-space. This is all the more significant as the intention is
from the outset to treat the field of the picture with reference to a certain time-of-day,
that is, historically. There are early mornings, sunset-clouds, the last
gleams upon the sky-line of distant mountains, the candle-lighted room, the
spring meadows and the autumn woods, the long and short shadows of bushes
and furrows. But they are all penetrated through and through with a subdued
darkness that is <em>not</em> derived from the motion of the heavenly bodies. In fact,
steady brightness and steady twilight are the respective hall-marks of the
Classical and the Western, alike in painting and in drama; and may we not also
describe Euclidean geometry as a mathematic of the day and Analysis as a
mathematic of the night?</p>

<p class='c001'>Change of scene, undoubtedly regarded by the Greeks as a sort of profanation,
is for us almost a religious necessity, a postulate of our world-feeling.
There seems something pagan in the fixed scene of Tasso. We <em>inwardly</em> need a
drama of perspectives and wide backgrounds, a stage that shakes off sensuous
limitations and draws the whole world into itself. In Shakespeare, who was
born when Michelangelo died and ceased to write when Rembrandt came into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>the world, dramatic infinity, the passionate overthrow of all static limitations,
attained the maximum. His woods, seas, alleys, gardens, battlefields lie in the
afar, the unbounded. Years fly past in the space of minutes. The mad Lear
between fool and reckless outcast on the heath, in the night and the storm, the
unutterably lonely ego lost in space—here is the Faustian life-feeling! From
such a scene as this it is but a step to the <em>inwardly</em> seen and <em>inwardly</em> felt landscapes
of the almost contemporary Venetian music; for on the Elizabethan
stage the whole thing was merely <em>indicated</em>, and it was the inner eye that out
of a few hints fashioned for itself an image of the world in which the scenes—far-fetched
always—played themselves out. Such scenes the Greek stage
could not have handled at all. The Greek scene is never a landscape; in general,
it is nothing, and at best it may be described as a basis for movable statues. The
figures are everything, in drama, as in fresco. It is sometimes said that Classical
man lacked the feeling for Nature. Insensitive to Faustian Nature, that of
space and of landscape, Classical man certainly was. <em>His</em> Nature was the <em>body</em>,
and if once we have let the sentiment of this sink into us, we suddenly comprehend
the eye with which the Greek would follow the mobile muscle-relief of
the nude body. This, and not clouds and stars and horizon, was his “Living
Nature.”</p>

<h4 class='c021'>VII</h4>

<p class='c018'>Now, whatever is sensuously-near is understandable for all, and therefore
of all the Cultures that have been, the Classical is the most popular,
and the Faustian the least popular, in its expressions of life-feeling. A
creation is “popular” that gives itself with all its secrets to the first
comer at the first glance that incorporates its meaning in its exterior and
surface. In any Culture, that element is “popular” which has come down
unaltered from primitive states and imaginings, which a man understands
from childhood without having to <em>master by effort</em> any really novel method or
standpoint—and, generally, that which is immediately and frankly evident
to the senses, as against that which is merely hinted at and has to be discovered—by
the few, and sometimes the very, very few. There are popular
ideas, works, men and landscapes. Every Culture has its own quite definite
sort of esoteric or popular character that is immanent in all its doings, so
far as these have symbolic importance. The commonplace eliminates differences
of spiritual breadth as well as depth between man and man, while the
esoteric emphasizes and strengthens them. Lastly, considered in relation to
the primary depth-experience of this and that kind of awakening man—that
is, in relation to the prime-symbol of his existence and the cast of his world-around—the
purely “popular” and naïve associates itself with the symbol
of the bodily, while to the symbol of endless Space belongs a frankly <em>un</em>-popular
relation between the creations and the men of the Culture.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>The Classical geometry is that of the child, that of any layman—Euclid’s
Elements are used in England as a school-book to this day. The workaday
mind will always regard this as the only true and correct geometry. All other
kinds of natural geometry that are possible (and have in fact, by an immense
effort of overcoming the popular-obvious, been discovered) are understandable
only for the circle of the professional mathematicians. The famous
“four elements” of Empedocles are those of every naïve man and his “instinctive”
physics, while the idea of isotopes which has come out of research into
radioactivity is hardly comprehensible even to the adept in closely-cognate
sciences. Everything that is Classical is comprehensible in <em>one</em> glance, be it the
Doric temple, the statue, the Polis, the cults; backgrounds and secrets there
are none. But compare a Gothic cathedral-façade with the Propylæa, an etching
with a vase-painting, the policy of the Athenian people with that of the
modern Cabinet. Consider what it means that every one of our epoch-making
works of poetry, policy and science has called forth a whole literature
of explanations, and not indubitably successful explanations at that. While
the Parthenon sculptures were “there” for every Hellene, the music of Bach
and his contemporaries was only for musicians. We have the types of the
Rembrandt expert, the Dante scholar, the expert in contrapuntal music, and
it is a reproach—a justifiable reproach—to Wagner that it was possible
for far too many people to be Wagnerians, that far too little of his music was
for the trained musician. But do we hear of Phidias-experts or even Homer-scholars?
Herein lies the explanation of a set of phenomena which we have
hitherto been inclined to treat—in a vein of moral philosophy, or, better,
of melodrama—as weaknesses common to humanity, but which are in fact
symptoms of the Western life-feeling, viz., the “misunderstood” artist, the
poet “left to starve,” the “derided discoverer,” the thinker who is “centuries
in advance of his time” and so on. These are types of an esoteric Culture.
Destinies of this sort have their basis in the passion of distance in which is
concealed the desire-to-infinity and the will-to-power, and they are as necessary
in the field of Faustian mankind—at all stages—as they are unthinkable
in the Apollinian.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every high creator in Western history has in reality aimed, from first to
last, at something which only the few could comprehend. Michelangelo made
the remark that his style was ordained for the correction of fools. Gauss concealed
his discovery of non-Euclidean geometry for thirty years, for fear of the
“clamour of the Bœotians.” It is only to-day that we are separating out the
masters of Gothic cathedral art from the rank-and-file. But the same applies
also to every painter, statesman, philosopher. Think of Giordano Bruno, or
Leibniz, or Kant, as against Anaximander, Heraclitus or Protagoras. What
does it mean, that no German philosopher worth mentioning can be understood
by the man in the street, and that the combination of simplicity with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>majesty that is Homer’s is simply not to be found in any Western language?
The Nibelungenlied is a hard, reserved utterance, and as for Dante, in Germany
at any rate the pretension to understand him is seldom more than a literary
pose. We find everywhere in the Western what we find nowhere in the Classical—the
exclusive form. Whole periods—for instance, the Provençal Culture
and the Rococo—are in the highest degree select and uninviting, their
ideas and forms having no existence except for a small class of higher men.
Even the Renaissance is no exception, for though it purports to be the rebirth
of that Antique which is so utterly <em>non</em>-exclusive and caters so frankly for all,
it is in fact, through-and-through, the creation of a circle or of individual
chosen souls, a taste that rejects popularity from the outset—and how deep this
sense of detachment goes we can tell from the case of Florence, where the
generality of the people viewed the works of the elect with indifference, or
with open mouths, or with dislike, and sometimes, as in the case of Savonarola,
turned and rent them. On the contrary, <em>every</em> Attic burgher belonged to the
Attic Culture, which excluded nobody; and consequently, the distinctions of
deeps and shallows, which are so decisively important for us, did not exist
at all for it. For us, popular and shallow are synonymous—in art as in science—but
for Classical man it was not so.</p>

<p class='c001'>Consider our sciences too. Every one of them, without exception, has
besides its elementary groundwork certain “higher” regions that are inaccessible
to the layman—symbols, these also, of our will-to-infinity and directional
energy. The public for whom the last chapters of up-to-date physics
have been written numbers at the utmost a thousand persons, and certain
problems of modern mathematics are accessible only to a much smaller circle
still—for our “popular” science is without value, <span lang="fr"><i>détraquée</i></span>, and falsified. We
have not only an art for artists, but also a mathematic for mathematicians, a
politic for politicians (of which the <span lang="la"><i>profanum vulgus</i></span> of newspaper-readers has not
the smallest inkling,<a id='r409'></a><a href='#f409' class='c019'><sup>[409]</sup></a> whereas Classical politics never got beyond the horizon of
the Agora), a religion for the “religious genius” and a poetry for philosophers.
Indeed, we may take the craving for wide effect as a sufficient index by itself
of the commencing and already perceptible decline of Western science. That
the severe esoteric of the Baroque Age is felt now as a burden, is a symptom
of sinking strength and of the dulling of that distance-sense which <em>confessed</em>
the limitation with humility. The few sciences that have kept the old fineness,
depth, and energy of conclusion and deduction and have not been tainted with
journalism—and few indeed they are, for theoretical physics, mathematics,
Catholic dogma, and perhaps jurisprudence exhaust the list—address themselves
to a very narrow and chosen band of experts. <em>And it is this expert, and
his opposite the layman, that are totally lacking in the Classical life, wherein everyone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>knows everything.</em> For us, the polarity of expert and layman has all the significance
of a high symbol, and when the tension of this distance is beginning to
slacken, there the Faustian life is fading out.</p>

<p class='c001'>The conclusion to be argued from this as regards the advances of Western
science in its last phase (which will cover, or quite possibly will <em>not</em> cover, the
next two centuries) is, that in proportion as megalopolitan shallowness and
triviality drive arts and sciences on to the bookstall and into the factory, the
posthumous spirit of the Culture will confine itself more and more to very
narrow circles; and that there, remote from advertisement, it will work in
ideas and forms so abstruse that only a mere handful of superfine intelligences
will be capable of attaching meanings to them.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>VIII</h4>

<p class='c018'>In no Classical art-work is a relation with the beholder attempted, for that
would require the form-language of the individual object to affirm and to make
use of the existence of a relation between that object and ambient unlimited
space. An Attic statue is a completely Euclidean body, timeless and relationless,
wholly self-contained. It neither speaks nor looks. <em>It is quite unconscious
of the spectator.</em> Unlike the plastic forms of every other Culture, it stands wholly
for itself and fits into no architectural order; it is an individual amongst individuals,
a body amongst bodies. And the living individuals merely perceive
it <em>as a neighbour</em>, and do not feel it as an invasive influence, an efficient capable
of traversing space. Thus is expressed the Apollinian life-feeling.</p>

<p class='c001'>The awakening Magian art at once reversed the meaning of these forms.
The eyes of the statues and portraits in the Constantinian style are big and
staring and very definitely directed. They represent the Pneuma, the higher of
the two soul-substances. The Classical sculptor had fashioned the eyes as
blind, but now the pupils are bored, the eye, unnaturally enlarged, looks into
the space that in Attic art it had not acknowledged as existing. In the Classical
fresco-painting, heads are turned towards one another, but in the mosaics of
Ravenna and even in the relief-work of Early-Christian-Late-Roman sarcophagi
they are always turned towards the beholder, and their wholly spiritual look
is fixed upon him. Mysteriously and quite un-Classically the beholder’s sphere
is invaded by an action-at-a-distance from the world that is in the art-work.
Something of this magic can still be traced in early Florentine and early Rhenish
gold-ground pictures.</p>

<p class='c001'>Consider, now, Western painting as it was after Leonardo, fully conscious
of its mission. How does it deal with infinite space as something <em>singular</em> which
comprehends both picture and spectator as mere centres of gravity of a spatial
dynamic? The full Faustian life-feeling, the passion of the third dimension,
takes hold of the form of the picture, the painted plane, and transforms it in
an unheard-of way. The picture no longer stands for itself, nor looks at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>spectator, but <em>takes him into its sphere</em>. The sector defined by the sides of the
frame—the peepshow-field, twin with the stage-field—represents universal
space itself. Foreground and background lose all tendency to materiality and
propinquity and disclose instead of marking off. Far horizons deepen the field to
infinity, and the colour-treatment of the close foreground eliminates the ideal
plane of separation formed by the canvas and thus expands the field so that
the spectator is <em>in</em> it. It is not he, now, who chooses the standpoint from which
the picture is most effective; on the contrary, the picture dictates position and
distance to him. Lateral limits, too, are done away with—from 1500 onwards
overrunnings of the frame are more and more frequent and daring. The
Greek spectator stands <em>before</em> the fresco of Polygnotus. We <em>sink into</em> a picture,
that is, we are pulled into it by the power of the space-treatment. Unity of
space being thus re-established, the infinity that is expanded in all directions
by the picture is ruled by the Western perspective;<a id='r410'></a><a href='#f410' class='c019'><sup>[410]</sup></a> and from perspective
there runs a road straight to the comprehension of our astronomical world-picture
and its passionate pioneering into unending farness.</p>

<p class='c001'>Apollinian man <em>did not want</em> to observe the broad universe, and the philosophical
systems one and all are silent about it. They know only problems
concerned with tangible and actual things, and have never anything positive
or significant to say about what is between the “things.” The Classical thinker
takes the earth-sphere, upon which he stands and which (even in Hipparchus)
is enveloped in a fixed celestial sphere, as the complete and <em>given</em> world, and if
we probe the depths and secrets of motive here we are almost startled by the
persistency with which theory attempted time after time to attach the order of
these heavens to that of the earth in some way that would not <a id='corr330.25'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='inpugn'>impugn</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_330.25'>impugn</a></span> the
primacy of the latter.<a id='r411'></a><a href='#f411' class='c019'><sup>[411]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Compare with this the convulsive vehemence with which the discovery of
Copernicus—the “contemporary” of Pythagoras—drove through the soul
of the West, and the deep spirit of awe in which Kepler looked upon the laws
of planetary orbits which he had discovered as an immediate revelation from
God, not daring to doubt that they were circular because any other form would
have been too unworthy a symbol. Here the old Northern life-feeling, the
Viking infinity-wistfulness, comes into its own. Here, too, is the meaning of
the characteristically Faustian discovery of the telescope which, penetrating
into spaces hidden from the naked eye and inaccessible to the will-to-power,
<em>widens</em> the universe that we possess. The truly religious feeling that seizes us
even to-day when we dare to look into the depths of starry space for the first
time—the same feeling of power that Shakespeare’s greatest tragedies aim
at awakening—would to Sophocles appear as the impiety of all impieties.</p>

<p class='c001'>Our denial of the “vault” of heaven, then, is a <em>resolve</em> and not a sense-experience.
The modern ideas as to the nature of starry space—or, to speak
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>more prudently, of an extension indicated by light-indices that are communicated
by eye and telescope—most certainly do not rest upon sure knowledge,
for what we see in the telescope is small bright disks of different sizes. The
photographic plate yields quite another picture—not a <em>sharper</em> one but a
<em>different</em> one—and the construction of a consistent world-picture such as we
crave depends upon connecting the two by numerous and often very daring
hypotheses (e.g., of distances, magnitudes and movements) that we ourselves
frame. The style of this picture corresponds to the style of our own soul. In
actual fact we do not know how different the light-powers of one and another
star may be, nor whether they vary in different directions. We do not know
whether or not light is altered, diminished, or extinguished in the immensities
of space. We do not know whether our earthly conceptions of the nature of
light, and therefore all the theories and laws deduced from them, have validity
beyond the immediate environment of the earth. What we “see” are merely
light-<em>indices</em>; what we understand are symbols of ourselves.</p>

<p class='c001'>The strong upspringing of the Copernican world-idea—which belongs
exclusively to our Culture and (to risk an assertion that even now may seem
paradoxical) would be and will be <em>deliberately forced into oblivion</em> whenever the
soul of a coming Culture shall feel itself endangered by it<a id='r412'></a><a href='#f412' class='c019'><sup>[412]</sup></a>—was founded on
the certainty that the corporeal-static, the imagined preponderance of the
plastic <em>earth</em>, was henceforth eliminated from the Cosmos. Till then, the heavens
which were thought of, or at any rate felt, as a substantial quantity, like
the earth, had been regarded as being in polar equilibrium with it. But now
it was <em>Space</em> that ruled the universe. “World” signifies space, and the stars
are hardly more than mathematical points, tiny balls in the immense, that
as material no longer affect the world-feeling. While Democritus, who tried
(as on behalf of the Apollinian Culture he was bound to try) to settle some
limit of a bodily kind to it all, imagined a layer of hook-shaped atoms as a skin
over the Cosmos, an insatiable hunger drives <em>us</em> ever further and further into
the remote. The solar system of Copernicus, already expanded by Giordano
Bruno to a thousand such systems, grew immeasurably wider in the Baroque
Age; and to-day we “know” that the sum of all the solar systems, about
35,000,000, constitutes a closed (and demonstrably finite<a id='r413'></a><a href='#f413' class='c019'><sup>[413]</sup></a>) stellar system
which forms an ellipsoid of rotation and has its equator approximately along
the band of the Milky Way. Swarms of solar systems traverse this space, like
flights of migrant birds, with the same velocity and direction. One such group,
with an apex in the constellation of Hercules, is formed by our sun together
with the bright stars Capella, Vega, Altair and Betelgeuse. The axis of this
immense system, which has its mid-point not far from the present position of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>our sun, is taken as 470,000,000 times as long as the distance from the earth to
the sun. Any night, the starry heavens give us at the same moment impressions
that originated 3,700 years apart in time, for that is the distance in
light-years from the extreme outer limit to the earth. In the picture of history
as it unfolds before us here, this period corresponds to a duration covering
the whole Classical and Magian ages and going back to the zenith of the
Egyptian Culture in the XIIth Dynasty. This aspect—an <em>image</em>, I repeat, and
not a matter of experimental knowledge—is for the Faustian a high and noble<a id='r414'></a><a href='#f414' class='c019'><sup>[414]</sup></a>
aspect, but for the Apollinian it would have been woeful and terrible, an annihilation
of the most profound conditions of his being. And he would have
felt it as sheer salvation when after all a limit, however remote, had been
found. But we, driven by the deep necessity that is in us, must simply ask
ourselves the new question: Is there anything <em>outside</em> this system? Are there
aggregates of such systems, at such distances that even the dimensions established
by our astronomy<a id='r415'></a><a href='#f415' class='c019'><sup>[415]</sup></a> are small by comparison? As far as sense-observations
are concerned, it seems that an absolute limit has been reached; neither
light nor gravitation can give a sign of existence through this outer space, void
of mass. But for us it is a simple <em>necessity of thought</em>. Our spiritual passion,
our unresting need to actualize our existence-idea in symbols, <em>suffers</em> under
this limitation of our sense-perceptions.</p>

<h4 class='c026'>IX</h4>

<p class='c018'>So also it was that the old Northern races, in whose primitive souls the
Faustian was already awakening, discovered in their grey dawn the art of
<em>sailing the seas</em> which emancipated them.<a id='r416'></a><a href='#f416' class='c019'><sup>[416]</sup></a> The Egyptians knew the sail, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>only profited by it as a labour-saving device. They sailed, as they had done
before in their oared ships, along the coast to Punt and Syria, but the <em>idea</em> of
the high-seas voyage—what it meant as a liberation, a symbol—was not
in them. Sailing, real sailing, is a triumph over Euclidean land. At the beginning
of our 14th Century, almost coincident with each other (and with the
formation-periods of oil-painting and counterpoint!) came gunpowder and the
compass, that is, <em>long-range weapons and long-range intercourse</em> (means that the
Chinese Culture<a id='r417'></a><a href='#f417' class='c019'><sup>[417]</sup></a> too had, necessarily, discovered for itself). It was the spirit
of the Vikings and the Hansa, as of those dim peoples, so unlike the Hellenes
with their domestic funerary urns, who heaped up great barrows as memorials
of the lonely soul on the wide plains. It was the spirit of those who sent their
dead kings to sea in their burning ships, thrilling manifests of their dark
yearning for the boundless. The spirit of the Norsemen drove their cockle-boats—in
the Tenth Century that heralded the Faustian birth—to the coasts
of America. But to the circumnavigation of Africa, already achieved by Egyptians
and Carthaginians, Classical mankind was wholly indifferent. How statuesque
their existence was, even with respect to intercourse, is shown by the
fact that the news of the First Punic War—one of the most intense wars of
history—penetrated to Athens from Sicily merely as an indefinite report.
Even the souls of the Greeks were assembled in Hades as unexcitable shadows
(εἴδωλα) without strength, wish or feeling. But the Northern dead gathered
themselves in fierce unresting armies of the cloud and the storm.</p>

<p class='c001'>The event which stands at the same cultural level as the discoveries of the
Spaniards and Portuguese is that of the Hellenic colonizations of the 8th Century
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span> But, while the Spaniards and the Portuguese were possessed by the
adventured-craving for uncharted distances and for everything unknown and
dangerous, the Greeks went carefully, point by point, on the known tracks of
the Phœnicians, Carthaginians and Etruscans, and their curiosity in no wise
extended to what lay beyond the Pillars of Hercules and the Isthmus of Suez,
easily accessible as both were to them. Athens no doubt heard of the way to
the North Sea, to the Congo, to Zanzibar, to India—in Nero’s time the position
of the southern extremity of India was known, also that of the islands of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>Sunda—but Athens shut its eyes to these things just as it did to the astronomical
knowledge of the old East. Even when the lands that we call Morocco
and Portugal had become Roman provinces, no Atlantic voyaging ensued, and
the Canaries remained forgotten. Apollinian man felt the Columbus-longing
as little as he felt the Copernican. Possessed though the Greek merchants were
with the desire of gain, a deep metaphysical shyness restrained them from
extending the horizon, and in geography as in other matters they stuck to near
things and foregrounds. The existence of the Polis, that astonishing ideal
of the State as statue, was in truth nothing more nor less than a refuge from the
wide world of the sea-peoples—and that though the Classical, alone of all
the Cultures so far, had a ring of coasts about a sea of islands, and not a continental
expanse, as its motherland. Not even Hellenism, with all its proneness
to technical diversions,<a id='r418'></a><a href='#f418' class='c019'><sup>[418]</sup></a> freed itself from the oared ship which tethered the
mariner to the coasts. The naval architects of Alexandria were capable of
constructing giant ships of 260-ft. length,<a id='r419'></a><a href='#f419' class='c019'><sup>[419]</sup></a> and, for that matter, the steamship
was discovered in principle. But there are some discoveries that have all the
pathos of a great and <em>necessary</em> symbol and reveal depths within, and there are
others that are merely play of intellect. The steamship is for Apollinians one
of the latter and for Faustians one of the former class. It is prominence or
insignificance in the Macrocosm as a whole that gives discovery and the application
thereof the character of depth or shallowness.</p>

<p class='c001'>The discoveries of Columbus and Vasco da Gama extended the geographical
horizon without limit, and the world-sea came into the same relation with
land as that of the universe of space with earth. And then first the political
tension within the Faustian world-consciousness discharged itself. For the
Greeks, Hellas was and remained the important part of the earth’s surface, but
with the discovery of America West-Europe became a province in a gigantic
whole. Thenceforward the history of the Western Culture has a <em>planetary</em>
character.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every Culture possesses a proper conception of home and fatherland, which
is hard to comprehend, scarcely to be expressed in words, full of dark metaphysical
relations, but nevertheless unmistakable in its tendency. The Classical
home-feeling which tied the individual corporally and Euclidean-ly to the
Polis<a id='r420'></a><a href='#f420' class='c019'><sup>[420]</sup></a> is the very antithesis of that enigmatic “Heimweh” of the Northerner
which has something musical, soaring and unearthly in it. Classical man felt
as “Home” just what he could see from the Acropolis of his native city. Where
the horizon of Athens ended, the alien, the hostile, the “fatherland” of another
began. Even the Roman of late Republican times understood by “patria”
nothing but Urbs Roma, not even Latium, still less Italy. The Classical world,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>as it matured, dissolved itself into a large number of point-patriæ, and the need
of bodily separation between them took the form of hatreds far more intense
than any hatred that there was of the Barbarian. And it is therefore the most
convincing of all evidences of the victory of the Magian world-feeling that
Caracalla<a id='r421'></a><a href='#f421' class='c019'><sup>[421]</sup></a> in 212 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> granted Roman citizenship to all provincials. For this
grant simply abolished the ancient, statuesque, idea of the citizen. There was
now a Realm and consequently a new kind of membership. The Roman notion
of an army, too, underwent a significant change. In genuinely Classical times
there had been no Roman Army in the sense in which we speak of the
Prussian Army, but only “armies,” that is, definite formations (as we say)
created as corps, limited and visibly present bodies, by the appointment of a
Legatus to command—an <span lang="de"><cite>exercitus Scipionis</cite></span>, <span lang="de"><cite>Crassi</cite></span> for instance—but never
an <span lang="de"><cite>exercitus Romanus</cite></span>. It was Caracalla, the same who abolished the idea of
“civis Romanus” by decree and wiped out the Roman civic deities by making
all alien deities equivalent to them, who created the un-Classical and <em>Magian</em>
idea of an Imperial Army, something <em>manifested</em> in the separate legions. These
now meant something, whereas in Classical times they <em>meant</em> nothing, but
simply <em>were</em>. The old <span lang="la">“fides exercituum”</span> is replaced by “fides exercitus” in
the inscriptions and, instead of individual bodily-conceived deities special to
each legion and ritually honoured by its Legatus, we have a spiritual principle
common to all. So also, and in the same sense, the "fatherland"-feeling undergoes
a change of meaning for Eastern men—<em>and not merely Christians</em>—in
Imperial times. Apollinian man, so long as he retained any effective remnant
at all of his proper world-feeling, regarded “home” in the genuinely corporeal
sense as the ground on which his city was built—a conception that recalls
the “unity of place” of Attic tragedy and statuary. But to Magian man, to
Christians, Persians, Jews, “Greeks,”<a id='r422'></a><a href='#f422' class='c019'><sup>[422]</sup></a> Manichæans, Nestorians and Mohammedans,
it means nothing that has any connexion with geographical actualities.
And for ourselves it means an impalpable unity of nature, speech, climate,
habits and history—not earth but “country,” not point-like presence but
historic past and future, not a unit made up of men, houses and gods but an
<em>idea</em>, the idea that takes shape in the restless wanderings, the deep loneliness,
and that ancient German impulse towards the South which has been the ruin
of our best, from the Saxon Emperors to Hölderlin and Nietzsche.</p>

<p class='c001'>The bent of the Faustian Culture, therefore, was overpoweringly towards
<em>extension</em>, political, economic or spiritual. It overrode all geographical-material
bounds. It sought—without any practical object, merely for the Symbol’s
own sake—to reach North Pole and South Pole. It ended by transforming
the entire surface of the globe into a single colonial and economic system.
Every thinker from Meister Eckhardt to Kant willed to subject the “phenomenal”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>world to the asserted domination of the cognizing ego, and every
leader from Otto the Great to Napoleon did it. The <em>genuine</em> object of their
ambitions was the boundless, alike for the great Franks and Hohenstaufen with
their world-monarchies, for Gregory VII and Innocent III, for the Spanish
Habsburgs “on whose empire the sun never set,” and for the Imperialism of
to-day on behalf of which the World-War was fought and will continue to be
fought for many a long day. Classical man, for inward reasons, could not be
a conqueror, notwithstanding Alexander’s romantic expedition—for we can
discern enough of the inner hesitations and unwillingnesses of his companions
not to need to explain it as an “exception proving the rule.”<a id='r423'></a><a href='#f423' class='c019'><sup>[423]</sup></a> The never-stilled
desire to be liberated from the binding element, to range far and free, which
is the essence of the fancy-creatures of the North—the dwarfs, elves and imps—is
utterly unknown to the Dryads and Oreads of Greece. Greek daughter-cities
were planted by the hundred along the rim of the Mediterranean, but not
one of them made the slightest real attempt to conquer and penetrate the hinterlands.
To settle far from the coast would have meant to lose sight of “home,”
while to settle in <em>loneliness</em>—the ideal life of the trapper and prairie-man of
America as it had been of Icelandic saga-heroes long before—was something
entirely beyond the possibilities of Classical mankind. Dramas like that of
the emigration to America—man by man, each on his own account, driven
by deep promptings to loneliness—or the Spanish Conquest, or the Californian
gold-rush, dramas of uncontrollable longings for freedom, solitude,
immense independence, and of giantlike contempt of all limitations whatsoever
upon the home-feeling—these dramas are Faustian and only Faustian.
No other Culture, not even the Chinese, knows them.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Hellenic emigrant, on the contrary, clung as a child clings to its
mother’s lap. To make a new city out of the old one, exactly like it, with the
same fellow citizens, the same gods, the same customs, with the linking sea
never out of sight, and there to pursue in the Agora the familiar life of the
ζῷον πολιτικόν—this was the limit of change of scene for the Apollinian
life. To us, for whom freedom of movement (if not always as a practical, yet
in any case as an ideal, right) is indispensable, such a limit would have been
the most crying of all slaveries. It is from the Classical point of view that the
oft-misunderstood expansion of Rome must be looked at. It was anything
rather than an <em>extension</em> of the fatherland; it confined itself exactly within
fields that had already been taken up by other culture-men whom they dispossessed.
Never was there a hint of dynamic world-schemes of the Hohenstaufen
or Habsburg stamp, or of an imperialism comparable with that of our
own times. The Romans made no attempt to penetrate the interior of Africa.
Their later wars were waged only for the <em>preservation</em> of what they already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>possessed, not for the sake of ambition nor under a significant stimulus from
within. They could give up Germany and Mesopotamia without regret.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, in fine, we look at it all together—the expansion of the Copernican
world-picture into that aspect of stellar space that we possess to-day; the
development of Columbus’s discovery into a worldwide command of the
earth’s surface by the West; the perspective of oil-painting and of tragedy-scene;
the sublimed home-feeling; the passion of our Civilization for swift
transit, the conquest of the air, the exploration of the Polar regions and the
climbing of almost impossible mountain-peaks—we see, emerging everywhere
the prime-symbol of the Faustian soul, Limitless Space. And those specially
(in form, uniquely) Western creations of the soul-myth called “Will,” “Force”
and “Deed” must be regarded as derivatives of this prime-symbol.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>I</h4>

<p class='c018'>We are now at last in a position to approach the phenomenon of <em>Morale</em>,<a id='r424'></a><a href='#f424' class='c019'><sup>[424]</sup></a> the
intellectual interpretation of Life by itself, to ascend the height from which it
is possible to survey the widest and gravest of all the fields of human thought.
At the same time, we shall need for this survey an objectivity such as no one has
as yet set himself seriously to gain. Whatever we may take Morale to be, it is no
part of Morale to provide its own <em>analysis</em>; and we shall get to grips with the
problem, not by considering what <em>should</em> be our acts and aims and standards,
but only by diagnosing the Western feeling in the very form of the enunciation.</p>

<p class='c001'>In this matter of morale, Western mankind, without exception, is under the
influence of an immense optical illusion. Everyone <em>demands</em> something of the
rest. We say “thou shalt” in the conviction that so-and-so in fact will, can
and must be changed or fashioned or arranged conformably to the order, and
our belief both in the efficacy of, and in our title to give, such orders is unshakable.
<em>That</em>, and nothing short of it, <em>is</em>, for us, morale. In the ethics of the
West everything is direction, claim to power, will to affect the distant. Here
Luther is completely at one with Nietzsche, Popes with Darwinians, Socialists
with Jesuits; for one and all, the beginning of morale is a claim to general and
permanent validity. It is a necessity of the Faustian soul that this should be
so. He who thinks or teaches “otherwise” is sinful, a backslider, a <em>foe</em>, and
he is fought down without mercy. You “shall,” the State “shall,” society
“shall”—this form of morale is to us self-evident; it represents the only
real meaning that we can attach to the word. But it was not so either in the
Classical, or in India, or in China. Buddha, for instance, gives a pattern to
take or to leave, and Epicurus offers counsel. Both undeniably are forms of
high morale, and neither contains the will-element.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>What we have entirely failed to observe is the peculiarity of moral <em>dynamic</em>.
If we allow that Socialism (in the ethical, not the economic, sense) is that
world-feeling which seeks to carry out its own views on behalf of all, then we
are all without exception, willingly or no, wittingly or no, Socialists. Even
Nietzsche, that most passionate opponent of “herd morale,” was perfectly
incapable of limiting his zeal to himself in the Classical way. He thought
only of “mankind,” and he attacked everyone who differed from himself.
Epicurus, on the contrary, was heartily indifferent to others’ opinions and acts
and never wasted one thought on the “transformation” of mankind. He and
his friends were content that <em>they</em> were as they were and not otherwise. The
Classical ideal was indifference (ἀπάθεια) to the course of the world—the
very thing which it is the whole business of Faustian mankind to master—and
an important element both of Stoic and of Epicurean philosophy was the
recognition of a category of things neither preferred nor rejected<a id='r425'></a><a href='#f425' class='c019'><sup>[425]</sup></a> (ἀδιάφορα).
In Hellas there was a pantheon of morales as there was of deities, as the peaceful
coexistence of Epicureans, Cynics and Stoics shows, but the Nietzschean Zarathustra—though
professedly standing beyond good and evil—breathes from
end to end the pain of seeing men to be other than as he would have them be,
and the deep and utterly un-Classical desire to devote a life to their reformation—his
own sense of the word, naturally, being the only one. It is just this, the
<em>general</em> transvaluation, that makes ethical monotheism and—using the word
in a novel and deep sense—socialism. All world-improvers are Socialists.
And consequently there are no Classical world-improvers.</p>

<p class='c001'>The moral imperative as the form of morale is Faustian and only Faustian.
It is wholly without importance that Schopenhauer denies theoretically the
will to live, or that Nietzsche will have it affirmed—these are superficial
differences, indicative of personal tastes and temperaments. The important
thing, that which makes Schopenhauer the progenitor of ethical modernity,
is that he too <em>feels</em> the whole world as Will, as movement, force, direction.
This basic feeling is not merely the foundation of our ethics, <em>it is itself our whole
ethics</em>, and the rest are bye-blows. That which we call not merely activity but
action<a id='r426'></a><a href='#f426' class='c019'><sup>[426]</sup></a> is a historical conception through-and-through, saturated with
directional energy. It is the proof of being, the dedication of being, in that
sort of man whose ego possesses the tendency to Future, who feels the
momentary present not as saturated being but as epoch, as turning-point, in a
great complex of becoming—and, moreover, feels it so of both his personal
life and of the life of history as a whole. Strength and distinctness of this consciousness
are the marks of higher Faustian man, but it is not wholly absent
in the most insignificant of the breed, and it distinguishes his smallest acts from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>those of any and every Classical man. It is the distinction between character
and attitude, between conscious becoming and simple accepted statuesque becomeness,
between will and suffering in tragedy.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the world as seen by the Faustian’s eyes, everything is motion with an
aim. He himself <em>lives</em> only under that condition, for to him life means struggling,
overcoming, winning through. The struggle for existence as ideal form
of existence is implicit even in the Gothic age (of the architecture of which it
is visibly the foundation) and the 19th Century has not invented it but merely
put it into mechanical-utilitarian form. In the Apollinian world there is no
such directional motion—the purposeless and aimless see-saw of Heraclitus’s
“becoming” (ἡ ὁδὸς ἄνω κάτω) is irrelevant here—no “Protestantism,”
no <span lang="de">“Sturm und Drang,”</span> no ethical, intellectual or artistic “revolution” to
fight and destroy the existent. The Ionic and Corinthian styles appear by the
side of the Doric without setting up any claim to sole and general validity,
but the Renaissance expelled the Gothic and Classicism expelled the Baroque
styles, and the history of every European literature is filled with battles over
form-problems. Even our monasticism, with its Templars, Franciscans, Dominicans
and the rest, takes shape as an order-<i>movement</i>, in sharp contrast to the
“askesis” of the Early-Christian hermit.</p>

<p class='c001'>To go back upon this basic form of his existence, let alone transform it, is
entirely beyond the power of Faustian man. It is presupposed even in efforts
to resist it. One fights against “advanced” ideas, but all the time he looks on
his fight itself as an advance. Another agitates for a “reversal,” but what he
intends is in fact a continuance of development. “Immoral” is only a new kind
of “moral” and sets up the same claim to primacy. The will-to-power is
intolerant—all that is Faustian wills to reign alone. The Apollinian feeling,
on the contrary, with its world of coexistent individual things, is tolerant as a
matter of course. But, if toleration is in keeping with will-less Ataraxia, it is
for the Western world with its oneness of infinite soul-space and the singleness
of its fabric of tensions the sign either of self-deception or of fading-out. The
Enlightenment of the 18th Century was tolerant towards—that is, careless
of—differences between the various Christian creeds, but in respect of its
own relation to the Church as a whole, it was anything but tolerant as soon
as the power to be otherwise came to it. The Faustian instinct, active, strong-willed,
as vertical in tendency as its own Gothic cathedrals, as upstanding as
its own <span lang="la">“ego habeo factum,”</span> looking into distance and Future, demands
toleration—<em>that is, room, space</em>—for its proper activity, but only for that.
Consider, for instance, how much of it the city democracy is prepared to accord
to the Church in respect of the latter’s management of religious powers, while
claiming for itself unlimited freedom to exercise its own and adjusting the
“common” law to conform thereto whenever it can. Every “movement”
means to <em>win</em>, while every Classical “attitude” only wants to <em>be</em> and troubles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>itself little about the Ethos of the neighbour. To fight for or against the trend
of the times, to promote Reform or Reaction, construction, reconstruction or
destruction—all this is as un-Classical as it is un-Indian. It is the old antithesis
of Sophoclean and Shakespearian tragedy, the tragedy of the man who
only wants to exist and that of the man who wants to win.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is quite wrong to bind up Christianity with the moral imperative. It was
not Christianity that transformed Faustian man, but Faustian man who transformed
Christianity—and he not only made it a new religion but also gave
it a new moral direction. The “it” became “I,” the passion-charged
centre of the world, the foundation of the great Sacrament of <em>personal</em> contrition.
Will-to-power even in ethics, the passionate striving to set up a proper
morale as a universal truth, and to enforce it upon humanity, to reinterpret or
overcome or destroy everything otherwise constituted—nothing is more
characteristically our own than this is. And in virtue of it the Gothic springtime
proceeded to a profound—and never yet appreciated—<em>inward transformation</em>
of the morale of Jesus. A quiet spiritual morale welling from Magian
feeling—a morale or conduct recommended as potent for salvation, a morale
the knowledge of which was communicated as a special act of grace<a id='r427'></a><a href='#f427' class='c019'><sup>[427]</sup></a>—was
recast as a <em>morale of imperative command</em>.<a id='r428'></a><a href='#f428' class='c019'><sup>[428]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Every ethical system, whether it be of religious or of philosophical origin,
has associations with the great arts and especially with that of architecture.
It is in fact a structure of propositions of causal character. Every truth that is
intended for practical application is propounded with a “because” and a
“therefore.” There is mathematical logic in them—in Buddha’s “Four
Truths” as in Kant’s “Critique of Practical Reason”<a id='r429'></a><a href='#f429' class='c019'><sup>[429]</sup></a> and in every popular
catechism. What is <em>not</em> in these doctrines of acquired truth is the uncritical
logic of the blood, which generates and matures those conduct-standards
(Sitten) of social classes and of practical men (e.g., the chivalry-obligations in
the time of the Crusades) that we only consciously realize when someone
infringes them. A systematic morale is, as it were, an Ornament, and it manifests
itself not only in precepts but also in the style of drama and even in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>choice of art-motives. The Meander, for example, is a Stoic motive. The
Doric column is the very embodiment of the Antique life-ideal. And just
<em>because</em> it was so, it was the one Classical “order” which the Baroque style
necessarily and frankly excluded; indeed, even Renaissance art was warned
off it by some very deep spiritual instinct. Similarly with the transformation
of the Magian dome into the Russian roof-cupola,<a id='r430'></a><a href='#f430' class='c019'><sup>[430]</sup></a> the Chinese landscape-architecture
of devious paths, the Gothic cathedral-tower. Each is an image of
the particular and unique morale which arose out of the waking-consciousness
of the Culture.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>II</h4>

<p class='c018'>The old riddles and perplexities now resolve themselves. There are as many
morales as there are Cultures, no more and no fewer. Just as every painter and
every musician has something in him which, by force of inward necessity,
never emerges into consciousness but dominates <span lang="de"><cite>a priori</cite></span> the form-language of
his work and differentiates that work from the work of every other Culture,
so every conception of Life held by a Culture-man possesses <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> (in the very
strictest Kantian sense of the phrase) a constitution that is deeper than all
momentary judgments and strivings and impresses the <em>style</em> of these with the
hall-mark of the particular Culture. The individual may act morally or immorally,
may do “good” or “evil” with respect to the primary feeling of his
Culture, but the theory of his actions is not a result but a datum. Each Culture
possesses its own standards, the validity of which begins and ends with it.
There is no general morale of humanity.</p>

<p class='c001'>It follows that there is not and cannot be any true “conversion” in the
deeper sense. Conscious behaviour of any kind that rests upon convictions is
a primary phenomenon, the basic tendency of an existence developed into a
“timeless truth.” It matters little what words or pictures are employed to express
it, whether it appears as the predication of a deity or as the issue of philosophic
meditation, as proposition or as symbol, as proclamation of proper or
confutation of alien convictions. It is enough that it is <em>there</em>. It can be wakened
and it can be put theoretically in the form of doctrine, it can change or
improve its intellectual vehicle but it cannot be begotten. Just as we are incapable
of altering our world-feeling—so incapable that even in trying to
alter it we have to follow the old lines and confirm instead of overthrowing
it—so also we are powerless to alter the ethical basis of our waking being.
A certain verbal distinction has sometimes been drawn between ethics the
science and morale the duty, but, as we understand it, the point of duty does
not arise. We are no more capable of converting a man to a morale alien to his
being than the Renaissance was capable of reviving the Classical or of making
anything but a Southernized Gothic, an anti-Gothic, out of Apollinian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>motives. We may talk to-day of transvaluing all our values; we may, as
Megalopolitans, “go back to” Buddhism or Paganism or a romantic Catholicism;
we may champion as Anarchists an individualist or as Socialists a collectivist
ethic—but in spite of all we do, will and feel the same. A conversion
to Theosophy or Freethinking or one of the present-day transitions from a
supposed Christianity to a supposed Atheism (or vice versa) is an alteration
of words and notions, of the religious or intellectual surface, no more. None
of our “movements” have changed <em>man</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>A strict morphology of all the morales is a task for the future. Here, too,
Nietzsche has taken the first and essential step towards the new standpoint.
But he has failed to observe his own condition that the thinker shall place
himself “beyond good and evil.” He tried to be at once sceptic <em>and</em> prophet,
moral critic <em>and</em> moral gospeller. It cannot be done. One cannot be a first-class
psychologist as long as one is still a Romantic. And so here, as in all his
crucial penetrations, he got as far as the door—and stood outside it. And so
far, no one has done any better. We have been blind and uncomprehending
before the immense wealth that there is in the moral as in other form-languages.
Even the sceptic has not understood his task; at bottom he, like others, sets up
his own notion of morale, drawn from his particular disposition and private
taste, as standard by which to measure others. The modern revolutionaires—Stirner,
Ibsen, Strindberg, Shaw—are just the same; they have only managed
to hide the facts (from themselves as well as from others) behind new formulæ
and catchwords.</p>

<p class='c001'>But a morale, like a sculpture, a music, a painting-art, is a self-contained
form-world expressing a life-feeling; it is a datum, fundamentally unalterable,
an inward necessity. It is ever true within its historical circle, ever untrue
outside it. As we have seen already,<a id='r431'></a><a href='#f431' class='c019'><sup>[431]</sup></a> what his several works are to the poet
or musician or painter, that its several art-genera are for the higher individual
that we call the Culture, viz., <em>organic units</em>; and that oil-painting as a whole,
act-sculpture as a whole and contrapuntal music as a whole, and rhymed lyric
and so on are all epoch-making, and as such take rank as major symbols of
Life. In the history of the Culture as in that of the individual existence, we are
dealing with the actualization of the possible; it is the story of an inner spirituality
becoming the <em>style of a world</em>. By the side of these great form-units,
which grow and fulfil themselves and close down within a predeterminate series
of human generations, which endure for a few centuries and pass irrevocably
into death, we see the group of Faustian morals and the sum of Apollinian
morals also as individuals of the higher order. That they <em>are</em>, is Destiny. They
are data, and revelation (or scientific insight, as the case may be) only put them
into shape for the consciousness.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is something, hardly to be described, that assembles all the theories
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>from Hesiod and Sophocles to Plato and the Stoa and opposes them collectively
to <em>all</em> that was taught from Francis of Assisi and Abelard to Ibsen and Nietzsche,
and even the morale of Jesus is only the noblest expression of a general
morale that was put into other forms by Marcion and Mani, by Philo and
Plotinus, by Epictetus, Augustine and Proclus. All Classical ethic is an ethic
of attitude, all Western an ethic of deed. And, likewise, the sum of all Indian
and the sum of all Chinese systems forms each a world of its own.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>III</h4>

<p class='c018'>Every Classical ethic that we know or can conceive of constitutes man an
individual static entity, a body among bodies, and all Western valuations
relate to him as a centre of effect in an infinite generality. Ethical Socialism
is neither more nor less than the sentiment of action-at-a-distance, the moral
pathos of the third dimension; and the root-feeling of Care—care for those
who are with us, and for those who are to follow—is its emblem in the sky.
Consequently there is for us something socialistic in the aspect of the Egyptian
Culture, while the opposite tendency to immobile attitude, to non-desire, to
static self-containedness of the individual, recalls the Indian ethic and the man
formed by it. The seated Buddha-statue (“looking at its navel”) and Zeno’s
Ataraxia are not altogether alien to one another. The ethical ideal of Classical
man was that which is led up to in his tragedy, and revealed in its Katharsis.
This in its last depths means the purgation of the Apollinian soul from its
burden of what is <em>not</em> Apollinian, not free from the elements of distance and
direction, and to understand it we have to recognize that Stoicism is simply
the mature form of it. That which the drama effected in a solemn hour, the
Stoa wished to spread over the whole field of life; viz., statuesque steadiness
and will-less ethos. Now, is not this conception of κάθαρσις closely akin to
the Buddhist ideal of Nirvana, which as a formula is no doubt very “late” but
as an essence is thoroughly Indian and traceable even from Vedic times? And
does not this kinship bring ideal Classical man and ideal Indian man very
close to one another and separate them both from that man whose ethic is
manifested in the Shakespearian tragedy of dynamic evolution and catastrophe?
When one thinks of it, there is nothing preposterous in the idea of Socrates,
Epicurus, and especially Diogenes, sitting by the Ganges, whereas Diogenes
in a Western megalopolis would be an unimportant fool. Nor, on the other
hand, is Frederick William I of Prussia, the prototype of the Socialist in the
grand sense, unthinkable in the polity of the Nile, whereas in Periclean Athens
he is impossible.</p>

<p class='c001'>Had Nietzsche regarded his own times with fewer prejudices and less disposition
to romantic championship of certain ethical creations, he would have
perceived that a specifically Christian morale of compassion in <em>his</em> sense does
not exist on West-European soil. We must not let the words of humane formulæ
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>mislead us as to their real significance. Between the morale that one has
and the morale that one thinks one has, there is a relation which is very obscure
and very unsteady, and it is just here that an incorruptible psychology would
be invaluable. Compassion is a dangerous word, and neither Nietzsche himself—for
all his maestria—nor anyone else has yet investigated the meaning—conceptual
and effective—of the word at different times. The Christian morale
of Origen’s time was quite different from the Christian morale of St. Francis’s.
This is not the place to enquire what <em>Faustian</em> compassion—sacrifice or ebullience
or again race-instinct in a chivalrous society<a id='r432'></a><a href='#f432' class='c019'><sup>[432]</sup></a>—means as against the
fatalistic Magian-Christian kind, how far it is to be conceived as action-at-a-distance
and <em>practical dynamic</em>, or (from another angle) as a proud soul’s demand
upon itself, or again as the utterance of an imperious distance-feeling. A fixed
stock of ethical phrases, such as we have possessed since the Renaissance, has
to cover a multitude of different ideas and a still greater multitude of different
meanings. When a mankind so historically and retrospectively disposed as we
are accepts the superficial as the real sense, and regards ideals as subject-matter
for mere knowing, it is really evidencing its veneration for the past—in this
particular instance, for religious tradition. The <em>text</em> of a conviction is never
a test of its <em>reality</em>, for man is rarely conscious of his own beliefs. Catchwords
and doctrines are always more or less popular and external as compared with
deep spiritual actualities. Our theoretical reverence for the propositions of the
New Testament is in fact of the same order as the theoretical reverence of the
Renaissance and of Classicism for antique art; the one has no more transformed
the spirit of men than the other has transformed the spirit of works. The oft-quoted
cases of the Mendicant Orders, the Moravians and the Salvation Army
prove by their very rarity, and even more by the slightness of the effects that
they have been able to produce, that they are exceptions in a quite different
generality—namely, the <em>Faustian-Christian</em> morale. That morale will not indeed
be found formulated, either by Luther or by the Council of Trent, but all
Christians of the great style—Innocent III and Calvin, Loyola and Savonarola,
Pascal and St. Theresa—have had it in them, even in unconscious contradiction
to their own formal teachings.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have only to compare the purely Western conception of the manly
virtue that is designated by Nietzsche’s <span lang="de">“moralinfrei”</span> <em>virtù</em>, the <span lang="it"><i>grandezza</i></span> of
Spanish and the <span lang="de"><i>grandeur</i></span> of French Baroque, with that very feminine ἀρετή of
the Hellenic ideal, of which the practical application is presented to us as capacity
for enjoyment (ἡδονή), placidity of disposition (γαλήνη, ἀπάθεια), absence
of wants and demands, and, above all, the so typical ἀταραξία. What Nietzsche
called the Blond Beast and conceived to be embodied in the type of Renaissance
Man that he so overvalued (for it is really only a jackal counterfeit of
the great Hohenstaufen Germans) is the utter antithesis to the type that is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>presented in every Classical ethic without exception and embodied in every
Classical man of worth. The Faustian Culture has produced a long series of
granite-men, the Classical never a one. For Pericles and Themistocles were
soft natures in tune with Attic καλοκἀγαθία, and Alexander was a Romantic
who never woke up, Cæsar a shrewd reckoner. Hannibal, the alien, was the
only “Mann” amongst them all. The men of the early time, as Homer presents
them to our judgment—the Odysseuses and Ajaxes—would have cut
a queer figure among the chevaliers of the Crusades. Very feminine natures,
too, are capable of brutality—a rebound-brutality of their own—and Greek
cruelty was of this kind. But in the North the great Saxon, Franconian and
Hohenstaufen emperors appear on the very threshold of the Culture, surrounded
by giant-men like Henry the Lion and Gregory VII. Then come the men of the
Renaissance, of the struggle of the two Roses, of the Huguenot Wars, the
Spanish Conquistadores, the Prussian electors and kings, Napoleon, Bismarck,
Rhodes. What other Culture has exhibited the like of these? Where in all
Hellenic history is so powerful a scene as that of 1176—the Battle of Legnano
as foreground, the suddenly-disclosed strife of the great Hohenstaufen and the
great Welf as background? The heroes of the Great Migrations, the Spanish
chivalry, Prussian discipline, Napoleonic energy—how much of the Classical
is there in these men and things? And where, on the heights of Faustian
morale, from the Crusades to the World War, do we find anything of the
“slave-morale,” the meek resignation, the deaconess’s Caritas?<a id='r433'></a><a href='#f433' class='c019'><sup>[433]</sup></a> Only in pious
and honoured words, nowhere else. The type of the very priesthood is
Faustian; think of those magnificent bishops of the old German empire who
on horseback led their flocks into the wild battle,<a id='r434'></a><a href='#f434' class='c019'><sup>[434]</sup></a> or those Popes who could
force submission on a Henry IV and a Frederick II, of the Teutonic Knights
in the Ostmark, of Luther’s challenge in which the old Northern heathendom
rose up against old Roman, of the great Cardinals (Richelieu, Mazarin,
Fleury) who shaped France. <em>That</em> is Faustian morale, and one must be blind
indeed if one does not see it efficient in the whole field of West-European
history. And it is only through such grand instances of worldly passion
which express the consciousness of a <em>mission</em> that we are able to understand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>those of grand spiritual passion, of the upright and forthright Caritas which
nothing can resist, the dynamic charity that is so utterly unlike Classical
moderation and Early-Christian mildness. There is a <em>hardness</em> in the sort of
com-passion that was practised by the German mystics, the German and Spanish
military Orders, the French and English Calvinists. In the Russian, the
Raskolnikov, type of charity a soul melts into the fraternity of souls, in the
Faustian it arises out of it. Here too <span lang="la">“ego habeo factum”</span> is the formula.
Personal charity is the justification before God of the Person, the individual.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is the reason why "compassion"-morale, in the everyday sense, always
respected by us so far as words go, and sometimes hoped for by the thinker, is
<em>never</em> actualized. Kant rejected it with decision, and in fact it is in profound
contradiction with the Categorical Imperative, which sees the meaning of Life
to lie in actions and not in surrender to soft opinions. Nietzsche’s “slave-morale”
is a phantom, <em>his master-morale is a reality</em>. It does not require formulation
to be effective—it is there, and has been from of old. Take away his
romantic Borgia-mask and his nebulous vision of supermen, and what is left
of his man is Faustian man himself, as he is to-day and as he was even in saga-days,
the type of an energetic, imperative and dynamic Culture. However it
may have been in the Classical world, <em>our</em> great well-doers are the great <em>doers</em>
whose forethought and care affects millions, the great statesmen and organizers.
"A higher sort of men, who thanks to their preponderance of will, knowledge,
wealth and influence make use of democratic Europe as their aptest and most
mobile tool, in order to bring into their own hands the destinies of the Earth
and as artists to shape ‘man’ himself. Enough—the time is coming when
men will unlearn and relearn the art of politics." So Nietzsche delivered himself
in one of the unpublished drafts that are so much more concrete than the
finished works. “We must either breed political capacities, or else be ruined
by the democracy that has been forced upon us by the failure of the older
alternatives,”<a id='r435'></a><a href='#f435' class='c019'><sup>[435]</sup></a> says Shaw in <cite>Man and Superman</cite>. Limited though his philosophic
horizon is in general, Shaw has the advantage over Nietzsche of more
practical schooling and less ideology, and the figure of the multimillionaire
Undershaft in <cite>Major Barbara</cite> translates the Superman-ideal into the unromantic
language of the modern age (which in truth is its real source for Nietzsche
also, though it reached him indirectly through Malthus and Darwin). It is
these fact-men of the grand style who are the representatives to-day of the
Will-to-Power over other men’s destinies and therefore of the Faustian ethic
generally. Men of this sort do not broadcast their millions to dreamers, “artists,”
weaklings and “down-and-outs” to satisfy a boundless benevolence;
they employ them for those who like themselves count as material for the
Future. They pursue a purpose with them. They make a centre of force for
the existence of generations which outlives the single lives. The mere money,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>too, can develop ideas and make history, and Rhodes—precursor of a type
that will be significant indeed in the 21st Century—provided, in disposing
of his possessions by will, that it should do so. It is a shallow judgment, and
one incapable of inwardly understanding history, that cannot distinguish the
literary chatter of popular social-moralists and humanity-apostles from the
deep ethical instincts of the West-European Civilization.</p>

<p class='c001'>Socialism—in its highest and not its street-corner sense—is, like every
other Faustian ideal, exclusive. It owes its popularity only to the fact that it
is completely misunderstood even by its exponents, who present it as a sum of
rights instead of as one of duties, an abolition instead of an intensification of
the Kantian imperative, a slackening instead of a tautening of directional
energy. The trivial and superficial tendency towards ideals of “welfare,” “freedom,”
“humanity,” the doctrine of the “greatest happiness of the greatest
number,” are mere negations of the Faustian ethic—a very different matter
from the tendency of Epicureanism towards the ideal of “happiness,” for the
condition of happiness was the actual sum and substance of the Classical ethic.
Here precisely is an instance of sentiments, to all outward appearance much the
same, but meaning in the one case everything and in the other nothing. From
this point of view, we might describe the content of the Classical ethic as
<em>philanthropy</em>, a boon conferred by the individual upon himself, his <em>soma</em>. The
view has Aristotle on its side, for it is exactly in this sense that he uses the word
φιλάνθρωπος, which the best heads of the Classicist period, above all Lessing,
found so puzzling. Aristotle describes the effect of the Attic tragedy on the
Attic spectator as philanthropic. Its Peripeteia relieves him from compassion
with himself. A sort of theory of master-morale and slave-morale existed also
in the early Hellenism, in Callicles for example—naturally, under strictly
corporeal-Euclidean postulates. The ideal of the first class is Alcibiades. He
did exactly what at the moment seemed to him best for his own person, and he
is felt to be, and admired as, the type of Classical Kalokagathia. But Protagoras
is still more distinct, with his famous proposition—essentially ethical
in intention—that man (each man for himself) is the measure of things. That
is master-morale in a statuesque soul.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>IV</h4>

<p class='c018'>When Nietzsche wrote down the phrase “transvaluation of all values” for
the first time, the spiritual movement of the centuries in which we are living
found at last its formula. Transvaluation of all values is the most fundamental
character of <em>every</em> civilization. For it is the beginning of a Civilization that it
remoulds all the forms of the Culture that went before, understands them otherwise,
practises them in a different way. It begets no more, but only reinterprets,
and herein lies the negativeness common to all periods of this character.
It assumes that the genuine act of creation has already occurred, and merely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>enters upon an inheritance of big actualities. In the Late-Classical, we find
the event taking place inside Hellenistic-Roman Stoicism, that is, the long
death-struggle of the Apollinian soul. In the interval from Socrates—who
was the spiritual father of the Stoa and in whom the first signs of inward
impoverishment and city-intellectualism became visible—to Epictetus and
Marcus Aurelius, every existence-ideal of the old Classical underwent transvaluation.
In the case of India, the transvaluation of Brahman life was complete
by the time of King Asoka (250 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>), as we can see by comparing the
parts of the Vedanta put into writing before and after Buddha. And ourselves?
Even now the ethical socialism of the Faustian soul, its fundamental ethic, as
we have seen, is being worked upon by the process of transvaluation as that
soul is walled up in the stone of the great cities. <em>Rousseau is the ancestor of this
socialism; he stands, like Socrates and Buddha, as the representative spokesman of a
great Civilization.</em> Rousseau’s rejection of all great Culture-forms and all significant
conventions, his famous “Return to the state of Nature,” his practical
rationalism, are unmistakable evidences. Each of the three buried a millennium
of spiritual depth. Each proclaimed his gospel to mankind, but it was
to the mankind of the city intelligentsia, which was tired of the town and the
Late Culture, and whose “pure” (i.e., soulless) reason longed to be free from
them and their authoritative form and their hardness, from the symbolism with
which it was no longer in living communion and which therefore it detested.
The Culture was annihilated by discussion. If we pass in review the great
19th-Century names with which we associate the march of this great drama—Schopenhauer,
Hebbel, Wagner, Nietzsche, Ibsen, Strindberg—we comprehend
in a glance that which Nietzsche, in a fragmentary preface to his incomplete
master-work, deliberately and correctly called the <em>Coming of Nihilism</em>. Every
one of the great Cultures knows it, for it is of deep necessity inherent in the
finale of these mighty organisms. Socrates was a nihilist, and Buddha. There
is an Egyptian or an Arabian or a Chinese de-souling of the human being, just
as there is a Western. This is a matter not of mere political and economic, nor
even of religious and artistic, transformations, nor of any tangible or factual
change whatsoever, but of the condition of a soul after it has actualized its
possibilities in full. It is easy, but useless, to point to the bigness of Hellenistic
and of modern European achievement. Mass slavery and mass machine-production,
“Progress” and Ataraxia, Alexandrianism and modern Science,
Pergamum and Bayreuth, social conditions as assumed in Aristotle and as
assumed in Marx, are merely symptoms on the historical surface. Not external
life and conduct, not institutions and customs, but deepest and last things are
in question here—the inward <em>finishedness</em> (<span lang="de">Fertigsein</span>) of megalopolitan man,
<em>and</em> of the provincial as well.<a id='r436'></a><a href='#f436' class='c019'><sup>[436]</sup></a> For the Classical world this condition sets in
with the Roman age; for us it will set in from about the year 2000.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>Culture and Civilization—the living body of a soul and the mummy of it.
For Western existence the distinction lies at about the year 1800—on the one
side of that frontier life in fullness and sureness of itself, formed by growth
from within, in one great uninterrupted evolution from Gothic childhood to
Goethe and Napoleon, and on the other the autumnal, artificial, rootless life
of our great cities, under forms fashioned by the intellect. Culture and Civilization—the
organism born of Mother Earth, and the mechanism proceeding
from hardened fabric. Culture-man lives inwards, Civilization-man outwards
in space and amongst bodies and “facts.” That which the one feels as Destiny
the other understands as a linkage of causes and effects, and thenceforward he
is a materialist—in the sense of the word valid for, and only valid for, Civilization—whether
he wills it or no, and whether Buddhist, Stoic or Socialist
doctrines wear the garb of religion or not.</p>

<p class='c001'>To Gothic and Doric men, Ionic and Baroque men, the whole vast form-world
of art, religion, custom, state, knowledge, social life was easy. They
could carry it and actualize it without “knowing” it. They had over the
symbolism of the Culture that unstrained mastery that Mozart possessed in
music. Culture is the self-evident. The feeling of strangeness in these forms,
the idea that they are a burden from which creative freedom requires to be
relieved, the impulse to overhaul the stock in order by the light of reason
to turn it to better account, the fatal imposition of thought upon the inscrutable
quality of creativeness, are all symptoms of a soul that is beginning
to tire. Only the sick man feels his limbs. When men construct an
unmetaphysical religion in opposition to cults and dogmas; when a “natural
law” is set up against historical law; when, in art, styles are invented
in place of <em>the</em> style that can no longer be borne or mastered; when men
conceive of the State as an “order of society” which not only can be but
must be altered<a id='r437'></a><a href='#f437' class='c019'><sup>[437]</sup></a>—then it is evident that something has definitely broken
down. The Cosmopolis itself, the supreme Inorganic, is there, settled in the
midst of the Culture-landscape, whose men it is uprooting, drawing into itself
and using up.</p>

<p class='c001'>Scientific worlds are superficial worlds, practical, soulless and purely extensive
worlds. The ideas of Buddhism, of Stoicism, and of Socialism alike
rest upon them.<a id='r438'></a><a href='#f438' class='c019'><sup>[438]</sup></a> Life is no longer to be lived as something self-evident—hardly
a matter of consciousness, let alone choice—or to be accepted as God-willed
destiny, but is to be treated as a problem, presented as the intellect sees
it, judged by “utilitarian” or “rational” criteria. This, at the back, is what
all three mean. The brain rules, because the soul abdicates. Culture-men live
unconsciously, Civilization-men consciously. The Megalopolis—sceptical,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>practical, artificial—<em>alone</em> represents Civilization to-day. The soil-peasantry
before its gates does not count. The “People” means the city-people, an inorganic
mass, something fluctuating. The peasant is <em>not</em> democratic—this
again being a notion belonging to mechanical and urban existence<a id='r439'></a><a href='#f439' class='c019'><sup>[439]</sup></a>—and he
is therefore overlooked, despised, detested. With the vanishing of the old
“estates”—gentry and priesthood—he is the only organic man, the sole
relic of the Early Culture. There is no place for him either in Stoic or in
Socialistic thought.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus the Faust of the First Part of the tragedy, the passionate student of
solitary midnights, is logically the progenitor of the Faust of the Second Part
and the new century, the type of a purely practical, far-seeing, outward-directed
activity. In him Goethe presaged, psychologically, the whole future
of West Europe. He is Civilization in the place of Culture, external mechanism
in place of internal organism, intellect as the petrifact of extinct soul. As the
Faust of the beginning is to the Faust of the end, so the Hellene of Pericles’s
age is to the Roman of Cæsar’s.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>V</h4>

<p class='c018'>So long as the man of a Culture that is approaching its fulfilment still
continues to live straight before him naturally and unquestioningly, his life
has a settled conduct. This is the <em>instinctive</em> morale, which may disguise itself
in a thousand controversial forms but which he himself does not controvert,
because he <em>has</em> it. As soon as Life is fatigued, as soon as a man is put on to the
artificial soil of great cities—which are intellectual worlds to themselves—and
needs a theory in which suitably to present Life to himself, morale turns
into a <em>problem</em>. Culture-morale is that which a man has, Civilization-morale
that which he looks for. The one is too deep to be exhaustible by logical
means, the other is a <em>function</em> of logic. As late as Plato and as late as Kant
ethics are still mere dialectics, a game with concepts, or the rounding-off of
a metaphysical system, something that at bottom would not be thought really
necessary. The Categorical Imperative is merely an abstract statement of what,
for Kant, was not in question at all. But with Zeno and with Schopenhauer
this is no longer so. It had become necessary to discover, to invent or to
squeeze into form, as a rule of being, that which was no longer anchored in
instinct; and at this point therefore begin the civilized ethics that are no longer
the reflection of Life but the reflection of Knowledge upon Life. One feels that
there is something artificial, soulless, half-true in all these <em>considered</em> systems
that fill the first centuries of all the Civilizations. They are not those profound
and almost unearthly creations that are worthy to rank with the great arts.
All metaphysic of the high style, all pure intuition, vanishes before the one
need that has suddenly made itself felt, the need of a <em>practical</em> morale for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>governance of a Life that can no longer govern itself. Up to Kant, up to Aristotle,
up to the Yoga and Vedanta doctrines, philosophy had been a sequence of
grand world-systems in which <em>formal</em> ethics occupied a very modest place. But
now it became “moral philosophy” with a metaphysic as background. The
enthusiasm of epistemology had to give way to hard practical needs. Socialism,
Stoicism and Buddhism are philosophies of this type.</p>

<p class='c001'>To look at the world, no longer from the heights as Æschylus, Plato, Dante
and Goethe did, but from the standpoint of oppressive <a id='corr355.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='actualitites'>actualities</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_355.8'>actualities</a></span> is <i>to exchange
the bird’s perspective for the frog’s</i>. This exchange is a fair measure of the fall
from Culture to Civilization. Every ethic is a formulation of a soul’s view of
its destiny—heroic or practical, grand or commonplace, manly or old-manly.
I distinguish, therefore, between a <em>tragic</em> and a <em>plebeian</em> morale. The tragic
morale of a Culture knows and grasps the heaviness of being, but it draws
therefrom the feeling of pride that enables the burden to be borne. So Æschylus,
Shakespeare, the thinkers of the Brahman philosophy felt it; so Dante and German
Catholicism. It is heard in the stern battle-hymn of Lutheranism <span lang="de">“Ein’
feste Burg ist unser Gott,”</span> and it echoes still in the Marseillaise. The plebeian
morale of Epicurus and the Stoa, the sects of Buddha’s day and the 19th Century
made rather battle-plans for the outmanœuvring of destiny. What Æschylus
did in grand, the Stoa did in little—no more fullness, but poverty, coldness
and emptiness of life—and all that Roman bigness achieved was to intensify
this same intellectual chill and void. And there is the same relation between
the ethical passion of the great Baroque masters—Shakespeare, Bach, Kant,
Goethe—the manly will to <em>inward mastery</em> of natural things that it felt to be
far below itself, and modern Europe’s state-provision, humanity-ideals, world-peace,
“greatest happiness of greatest number,” etc., which express the will
to an <em>outward clearance from the path</em> of things that are on the same level. This,
no less than the other, is a manifestation of the will-to-power, as against the
Classical endurance of the inevitable, but the fact remains that material bigness
is not the same as metaphysical majesty of achievement. The former lacks
depth, lacks that which former men had called God. The Faustian world-feeling
of <em>deed</em>, which had been efficient in every great man from the Hohenstaufen
and the Welf to Frederick the Great, Goethe and Napoleon, smoothes
itself down to a philosophy of <em>work</em>. Whether such a philosophy attacks or
defends work does not affect its inward value. The Culture-idea of Deed and
the Civilization-idea of Work are related as the attitude of Æschylus’s Prometheus
and that of Diogenes. The one suffers and bears, the other lolls. It
was <em>deeds</em> of science that Galileo, Kepler and Newton performed, but it is
<em>scientific work</em> that the modern physicist carries out. And, in spite of all the
great words from Schopenhauer to Shaw, it is the plebeian morale of every
day and “sound human reason” that is the basis of all our expositions and
discussions of Life.</p>

  <h4 class='c021'>VI</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Each Culture, further, has <em>its own mode of spiritual extinction</em>, which is that
which follows of necessity from its life as a whole. And hence Buddhism,
Stoicism and Socialism are morphologically equivalent as end-phenomena.</p>

<p class='c001'>For even Buddhism is such. Hitherto the deeper meaning of it has always
been misunderstood. It was <em>not</em> a Puritan movement like, for instance, Islamism
and Jansenism, <em>not</em> a Reformation as the Dionysiac wave was for the Apollinian
world, and, quite generally, <em>not</em> a religion like the religions of the Vedas
or the religion of the Apostle Paul,<a id='r440'></a><a href='#f440' class='c019'><sup>[440]</sup></a> but a final and purely practical world-sentiment
of tired megalopolitans who had a closed-off Culture behind them
and no future before them. It was the basic feeling of the Indian Civilization
and as such both equivalent to and “contemporary” with Stoicism and Socialism.
The quintessence of this thoroughly worldly and unmetaphysical thought
is to be found in the famous sermon near Benares, the Four Noble Truths that
won the prince-philosopher his first adherents.<a id='r441'></a><a href='#f441' class='c019'><sup>[441]</sup></a> Its roots lay in the rationalist-atheistic
Sankhya philosophy, the world-view of which it tacitly accepts, just
as the social ethic of the 19th Century comes from the Sensualism and Materialism
of the 18th and the Stoa (in spite of its superficial exploitation of Heraclitus)
is derived from Protagoras and the Sophists. In each case it is the all-power of
Reason that is the starting-point from which to discuss morale, and religion
(in the sense of belief in anything metaphysical) does not enter into the matter.
Nothing could be more irreligious than these systems in their original forms—and
it is these, and not derivatives of them belonging to later stages of the
Civilizations, that concern us here.</p>

<p class='c001'>Buddhism rejects all speculation about God and the cosmic problems; only
self and the conduct of actual life are important to it. And it definitely did not
recognize a soul. The standpoint of the Indian psychologist of early Buddhism
was that of the Western psychologist and the Western “Socialist” of to-day,
who reduce the inward man to a bundle of sensations and an aggregation of
electrochemical energies. The teacher Nagasena tells King Milinda<a id='r442'></a><a href='#f442' class='c019'><sup>[442]</sup></a> that the
parts of the car in which he is journeying are not the car itself, that “car” is
only a word and that so also is the soul. The spiritual elements are designated
<em>Skandhas</em>, groups, and are impermanent. Here is complete correspondence with
the ideas of association-psychology, and in fact the doctrines of Buddha contain
much materialism.<a id='r443'></a><a href='#f443' class='c019'><sup>[443]</sup></a> As the Stoic appropriated Heraclitus’s idea of Logos and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>flattened it to a materialist sense, as the Socialism based on Darwin has mechanicalized
(with the aid of Hegel) Goethe’s deep idea of development, so Buddhism
treated the Brahman notion of <em>Karma</em>, the idea (hardly achievable in our
thought) of a being actively completing itself. Often enough it regarded this
quite materially as a world-stuff under transformation.</p>

<p class='c001'>What we have before us is three forms of Nihilism, using the word in
Nietzsche’s sense. In each case, the ideals of yesterday, the religious and
artistic and political forms that have grown up through the centuries, are
undone; yet even in this last act, this self-repudiation, each several Culture
employs the prime-symbol of its whole existence. The Faustian nihilist—Ibsen
or Nietzsche, Marx or Wagner—shatters the ideals. The Apollinian—Epicurus
or Antisthenes or Zeno—watches them crumble before his eyes.
And the Indian withdraws from their presence into himself. Stoicism is directed
to <em>individual self-management</em>, to statuesque and purely present being, without
regard to future or past or neighbour. Socialism is the dynamic treatment of
the same theme; it is defensive like Stoicism, but what it defends is not the
pose but the working-out of the life; and more, it is offensive-defensive, for
with a powerful thrust into distance it spreads itself into all future and over
all mankind, which shall be brought under one single regimen. Buddhism,
which only a mere dabbler in religious research could compare with Christianity,<a id='r444'></a><a href='#f444' class='c019'><sup>[444]</sup></a>
is hardly reproducible in words of the Western languages. But it is
permissible to speak of a Stoic Nirvana and point to the figure of Diogenes, and
even the notion of a Socialist Nirvana has its justification in so far that European
weariness covers its flight from the struggle for existence under catchwords of
world-peace, Humanity and brotherhood of Man. Still, none of this comes
anywhere near the strange profundity of the Buddhist conception of Nirvana.
It would seem as though the soul of an old Culture, when from its last refinements
it is passing into death, clings, as it were, jealously to the property that
is most essentially its own, to its form-content and the innate prime-symbol.
There is nothing in Buddhism that could be regarded as “Christian,” nothing
in Stoicism that is to be found in the Islam of <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1000, nothing that Confucius
shares with Socialism. The phrase <span lang="la">“si duo faciunt idem, non est idem”</span>—which
ought to appear at the head of every historical work that deals with
living and uniquely-occurring Becomings and not with logically, causally and
numerically comprehensible Becomes—is specially applicable to these final expressions
of Culture-movements. In all Civilizations being ceases to be suffused
with soul and comes to be suffused with intellect, but in each several Civilization
the intellect is of a particular structure and subject to the form-language of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>a particular symbolism. And just because of all this individualness of the Being
which, working in the unconscious, fashions the last-phase creations on the
historical surface, relationship of the instances to one another <em>in point of historical
position</em> becomes decisively important. What they bring to expression is
different in each case, but the fact that they bring it to expression <em>so</em> marks
them as “contemporary” with one another. The Buddhistic abnegation of full
resolute life has a Stoic flavour, the Stoic abnegation of the same a Buddhistic
flavour. Allusion has already been made to the affinity between the Katharsis
of the Attic drama and the Nirvana-idea. One’s feeling is that ethical Socialism,
although a century has already been given to its development, has
not yet reached the clear hard resigned form of its own that it will finally possess.
Probably the next decades will impart to it the ripe formulation that
Chrysippus imparted to the Stoa. But even now there is a look of the Stoa in
Socialism, when it is that of the higher order and the narrower appeal, when its
tendency is the Roman-Prussian and entirely unpopular tendency to self-discipline
and self-renunciation from sense of great duty; and a look of Buddhism
in its contempt for momentary ease and <span lang="la"><i>carpe diem</i></span>. And, on the other hand, it
has unmistakably the Epicurean look in that mode of it which alone makes it
effective downward and outward as a popular ideal, in which it is a hedonism
(not indeed of each-for-himself, but) of individuals in the name of all.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every soul has religion, which is only another word for its existence. All
living forms in which it expresses itself—all arts, doctrines, customs, all
metaphysical and mathematical form-worlds, all ornament, every column and
verse and idea—are ultimately religious, and <em>must</em> be so. But from the setting-in
of Civilization they <em>cannot</em> be so any longer. As the essence of every Culture
is religion, so—and <em>consequently</em>—the essence of every Civilization is irreligion—the
two words are synonymous. He who cannot feel this in the creativeness
of Manet as against Velasquez, of Wagner as against Haydn, of
Lysippus as against Phidias, of Theocritus as against Pindar, knows not what
the best means in art. Even Rococo in its worldliest creations is still religious.
But the buildings of Rome, even when they are temples, are irreligious; the one
touch of religious architecture that there was in old Rome was the intrusive
Magian-souled Pantheon, first of the mosques. The megalopolis itself, as
against the old Culture-towns—Alexandria as against Athens, Paris as against
Bruges, Berlin as against Nürnberg—is irreligious<a id='r445'></a><a href='#f445' class='c019'><sup>[445]</sup></a> down to the last detail,
down to the look of the streets, the dry intelligence of the faces.<a id='r446'></a><a href='#f446' class='c019'><sup>[446]</sup></a> And, correspondingly,
the ethical sentiments belonging to the form-language of the
megalopolis are irreligious and soulless also. Socialism is the Faustian world-feeling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>become irreligious; “Christianity,” so called (and qualified even as
“true Christianity”), is always on the lips of the English Socialist, to whom
it seems to be something in the nature of a “dogma-less morale.” Stoicism
also was irreligious as compared with Orphic religion, and Buddhism as compared
with Vedic, and it is of no importance whatever that the Roman Stoic
approved and conformed to Emperor-worship, that the later Buddhist sincerely
denied his atheism, or that the Socialist calls himself an earnest Freethinker or
even goes on believing in God.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is this extinction of living inner religiousness, which gradually tells upon
even the most insignificant element in a man’s being, that becomes phenomenal
in the historical world-picture at the turn from the Culture to the Civilization,
the <em>Climacteric</em> of the Culture, as I have already called it, the time of change in
which a mankind loses its spiritual fruitfulness for ever, and building takes the
place of begetting. Unfruitfulness—understanding the word in all its direct
seriousness—marks the brain-man of the megalopolis, as the sign of fulfilled
destiny, and it is one of the most impressive facts of historical symbolism that
the change manifests itself not only in the extinction of great art, of great courtesy,
of great formal thought, of the great style in all things, but also quite carnally
in the childlessness and “race-suicide” of the civilized and rootless strata,
a phenomenon not peculiar to ourselves but already observed and deplored—and
of course not remedied—in Imperial Rome and Imperial China.<a id='r447'></a><a href='#f447' class='c019'><sup>[447]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c021'>VII</h4>

<p class='c018'>As to the living representatives of these new and purely intellectual creations,
the men of the “New Order” upon whom every decline-time founds such
hopes, we cannot be in any doubt. They are the fluid megalopolitan Populace,
the rootless city-mass (οἱ πολλοί, as Athens called it) that has replaced the
People, the Culture-folk that was sprung from the soil and peasantlike even
when it lived in towns. They are the market-place loungers of Alexandria and
Rome, the newspaper-readers of our own corresponding time; the “educated”
man who then and now makes a cult of intellectual mediocrity and a church of
advertisement;<a id='r448'></a><a href='#f448' class='c019'><sup>[448]</sup></a> the man of the theatres and places of amusement, of sport and
“best-sellers.” It is this late-appearing mass and <em>not</em> “mankind” that is the
object of Stoic and Socialist propaganda, and one could match it with equivalent
phenomena in the Egyptian New Empire, Buddhist India and Confucian
China.</p>

<p class='c001'>Correspondingly, there is a characteristic form of public effect, the <em>Diatribe</em>.<a id='r449'></a><a href='#f449' class='c019'><sup>[449]</sup></a>
First observed as a Hellenistic phenomenon, it is an efficient form in <em>all</em>
Civilizations. Dialectical, practical and plebeian through and through, it replaces
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>the old meaningful and far-ranging Creation of the great man by the
unrestrained Agitation of the small and shrewd, ideas by aims, symbols by
programs. The expansion-element common to all Civilizations, the imperialistic
substitution of outer space for inner spiritual space, characterizes this also.
Quantity replaces quality, spreading replaces deepening. We must not confuse
this hurried and shallow activity with the Faustian will-to-power. All it
means is that creative inner life is at an end and intellectual existence can only
be kept up materially, by outward effect in the space of the City. Diatribe
belongs necessarily to the “religion of the irreligious” and is the characteristic
form that the “cure of souls” takes therein. It appears as the Indian preaching,
the Classical rhetoric, and the Western journalism. It appeals not to the best
but to the most, and it values its means according to the number of successes
obtained by them. It substitutes for the old thoughtfulness an <em>intellectual
male-prostitution</em> by speech and writing, which fills and dominates the halls and
the market-places of the megalopolis. As the whole of Hellenistic philosophy
is rhetorical, so the social-ethic system of Zola’s novel and Ibsen’s drama is
journalistic. If Christianity in its original expansion became involved with this
<a id='corr360.18'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='spritual'>spiritual</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_360.18'>spiritual</a></span> prostitution, it must not be confounded with it. The essential point of
Christian missionarism has almost always been missed.<a id='r450'></a><a href='#f450' class='c019'><sup>[450]</sup></a> Primitive Christianity
was a <em>Magian</em> religion and the soul of its Founder was utterly incapable of this
brutal activity without tact or depth. And it was the Hellenistic practice of
Paul<a id='r451'></a><a href='#f451' class='c019'><sup>[451]</sup></a> that—against the determined opposition of the original community,
as we all know—introduced it into the noisy, urban, demagogic publicity of
the Imperium Romanum. Slight as his Hellenistic tincture may have been, it
sufficed to make him outwardly a part of the Classical Civilization. Jesus had
drawn unto himself fishermen and peasants, Paul devoted himself to the market-places
of the great cities and the megalopolitan form of propaganda. The word
“pagan” (man of the heath or country-side) survives to this day to tell us who
it was that this propaganda affected <em>last</em>. What a difference, indeed what
diametrical opposition, between Paul and Boniface the passionate Faustian of
woods and lone valleys, the joyous cultivating Cistercians, the Teutonic
Knights of the Slavonic East! <em>Here</em> was youth once more, blossoming and yearning
in a peasant landscape, and not until the 19th Century, when that landscape
and all pertaining to it had aged into a world based on the megalopolis
and inhabited by the masses, did Diatribe appear in it. A true peasantry enters
into the field of view of Socialism as little as it did into those of Buddha and the
Stoa. It is only now, in the Western megalopolis, that the equivalent of the
Paul-type emerges, to figure in Christian or anti-Christian, social or theosophical
“causes,” Free Thought or the making of religious fancy-ware.</p>

<p class='c001'>This decisive turn towards the one remaining kind of life—that is, life as
a fact, seen biologically and under causality-relations instead of as Destiny—is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>particularly manifest in the ethical passion with which men now turn to
philosophies of digestion, nutrition and hygiene. Alcohol-questions and
Vegetarianism are treated with religious earnestness—such, apparently, being
the gravest problems that the “men of the New Order,” the generations of frog-perspective,
are capable of tackling. Religions, as they are when they stand
new-born on the threshold of the new Culture—the Vedic, the Orphic, the
Christianity of Jesus and the Faustian Christianity of the old Germany of
chivalry—would have felt it degradation even to glance at questions of this
kind. Nowadays, one <em>rises</em> to them. Buddhism is unthinkable without a
bodily diet to match its spiritual diet, and amongst the Sophists, in the circle
of Antisthenes, in the Stoa and amongst the Sceptics such questions became ever
more and more prominent. Even Aristotle wrote on the alcohol-question, and
a whole series of philosophers took up that of vegetarianism. And the only
difference between Apollinian and Faustian methods here is that the Cynic
theorized about his own digestion while Shaw treats of “everybody’s.” The
one disinterests himself, the other dictates. Even Nietzsche, as we know,
handled such questions with relish in his <span lang="la"><cite>Ecce Homo</cite></span>.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>VIII</h4>

<p class='c018'>Let us, once more, review Socialism (independently of the economic movement
of the same name) as the Faustian example of Civilization-ethics. Its
friends regard it as the form of the future, its enemies as a sign of downfall, and
both are equally right. We are all Socialists, wittingly or unwittingly, willingly
or unwillingly. Even resistance to it wears its form.</p>

<p class='c001'>Similarly, and equally necessarily, all Classical men of the Late period were
Stoics unawares. The whole Roman people, as a body, has a Stoic soul. The
genuine Roman, the very man who fought Stoicism hardest, was a Stoic of
a stricter sort than ever a Greek was. The Latin language of the last centuries
before Christ was the mightiest of Stoic creations.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>Ethical Socialism is the maximum possible of attainment to a life-feeling under the
aspect of Aims</em>;<a id='r452'></a><a href='#f452' class='c019'><sup>[452]</sup></a> for the directional movement of Life that is felt as Time and
Destiny, when it hardens, takes the form of an intellectual machinery of means
and end. Direction is the living, aim the dead. The passionate energy of the
advance is generically Faustian, the mechanical remainder—“Progress”—is
specifically Socialistic, the two being related as body and skeleton. And of the
two it is the generic quality that distinguishes Socialism from Buddhism and
Stoicism; these, with their respective ideals of Nirvana and Ataraxia, are no
less mechanical in design than Socialism is, but they know nothing of the latter’s
dynamic energy of expansion, of its will-to-infinity, of its passion of the
third dimension.</p>

<p class='c001'>In spite of its foreground appearances, ethical Socialism is <em>not</em> a system of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>compassion, humanity, peace and kindly care, but one of will-to-power. Any
other reading of it is illusory. The aim is through and through imperialist;
welfare, but welfare in the expansive sense, the welfare not of the diseased but
of the energetic man who ought to be given and must be given <em>freedom to do</em>, regardless
of obstacles of wealth, birth and tradition. Amongst us, sentimental
morale, morale directed to happiness and usefulness, is <em>never</em> the final instinct,
however we may persuade ourselves otherwise. The head and front of moral
modernity must ever be Kant, who (in this respect Rousseau’s pupil) excludes
from his ethics the motive of Compassion and lays down the formula “<em>Act</em>, so
that....” All ethic in this style expresses and is meant to express the will-to-infinity,
and this will demands conquest of the moment, the present, and the
foreground of life. In place of the Socratic formula “Knowledge is Virtue”
we have, even in Bacon, the formula “Knowledge is Power.” The Stoic takes
the world as he finds it, but the Socialist wants to organize and recast it in form
and substance, to fill it with <em>his own</em> spirit. The Stoic adapts himself, the
Socialist commands. He would have the whole world bear the form of <em>his</em>
view, thus transferring the idea of the “Critique of Pure Reason” into the
ethical field. This is the ultimate meaning of the Categorical Imperative, which
he brings to bear in political, social and economic matters alike—act as though
the maxims that you practise <em>were to become by your will the law for all</em>. And this
tyrannical tendency is not absent from even the shallowest phenomena of the
time.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not attitude and mien, but activity that is to be given form. As in
China and in Egypt, life only counts in so far as it is deed. And it is the mechanicalizing
of the organic concept of Deed that leads to the concept of <em>work</em>
as commonly understood, <em>the civilised form of Faustian effecting</em>. This morale,
the insistent tendency to give to Life the most active forms imaginable, is
stronger than reason, whose moral programs—be they never so reverenced,
inwardly believed or ardently championed—are only <em>effective</em> in so far as they
either lie, or are mistakenly supposed to lie, in the direction of this force.
Otherwise they remain mere words. We have to distinguish, in all modernism,
between the popular side with its <span lang="it"><i>dolce far niente</i></span>, its solicitude for health, happiness,
freedom from care, and universal peace—in a word, its supposedly
Christian ideals—and the higher Ethos which values deeds only, which (like
everything else that is Faustian) is neither understood nor desired by the
masses, which <em>grandly idealizes the Aim and therefore Work</em>. If we would set against
the Roman <span lang="la">“panem et circenses”</span> (the final life-symbol of Epicurean-Stoic
existence, and, at bottom, of Indian existence also) some corresponding symbol
of the North (and of Old China and Egypt) it would be <em>the</em> “<em>Right to Work</em>.”
This was the basis of Fichte’s thoroughly Prussian (and now European) conception
of State-Socialism, and in the last terrible stages of evolution it will
culminate in the <em>Duty to Work</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>Think, lastly, of the Napoleonic in it, the "<span lang="la"><i>ære perennius</i></span>," the will-to-duration.
Apollinian man looked <em>back</em> to a Golden Age; this relieved him of
the trouble of thinking upon what was still to come. The Socialist—the
dying Faust of Part II—is the man of historical care, who feels the Future as
his task and aim, and accounts the happiness of the moment as worthless in
comparison. The Classical spirit, with its oracles and its omens, wants only
to <em>know</em> the future, but the Westerner would <em>shape</em> it. <em>The Third Kingdom is the
Germanic ideal.</em> From Joachim of Floris to Nietzsche and Ibsen—arrows of
yearning to the other bank, as the Zarathustra says—every great man has
linked his life to an eternal <em>morning</em>. Alexander’s life was a wondrous paroxysm,
a dream which conjured up the Homeric ages from the grave. Napoleon’s life
was an immense toil, not for himself nor for France, but for the Future.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is well, at this point, to recall once more that each of the different great
Cultures has pictured <em>world-history</em> in its own special way. Classical man only
saw himself and his fortunes as statically present with himself, and did not ask
“whence” or “whither.” Universal history was for him an impossible notion.
This is the static way of looking at history. Magian man sees it as the great
cosmic drama of creation and foundering, the struggle between Soul and Spirit,
Good and Evil, God and Devil—a strictly-defined happening with, as its culmination,
<em>one single Peripeteia</em>—the appearance of the Saviour. Faustian man
sees in history a tense unfolding towards an <em>aim</em>; its “ancient-mediæval-modern”
sequence is a <em>dynamic</em> image. He <em>cannot</em> picture history to himself in
any other way. This scheme of three parts is not indeed world-history as such,
general world-history. But it <em>is</em> the image of world-history as it is conceived
in the Faustian style. It begins to be true and consistent with the beginning of
the Western Culture and ceases with its ceasing; and Socialism in the highest
sense is logically the crown of it, the form of its conclusive state that has been
implicit in it from Gothic onwards.</p>

<p class='c001'>And here Socialism—in contrast to Stoicism and Buddhism—becomes
tragic. It is of the deepest significance that Nietzsche, so completely clear and
sure in dealing with what should be <a id='corr363.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='destoyed'>destroyed</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_363.31'>destroyed</a></span>, what transvalued, loses himself
in nebulous generalities as soon as he comes to discuss the Whither, the Aim.
His criticism of decadence is unanswerable, but his theory of the Superman is a
castle in the air. It is the same with Ibsen—“Brand” and “Rosmersholm,”
“Emperor and Galilean” and “Master-builder”—and with Hebbel, with
Wagner and with everyone else. And therein lies a deep necessity; for, from
Rousseau onwards, Faustian man has nothing more to hope for in anything pertaining
to the grand style of Life. Something has come to an end. The Northern
soul has exhausted its inner possibilities, and of the dynamic force and
insistence that had expressed itself in world-historical visions of the future—visions
of millennial scope—nothing remains but the mere pressure, the passion
yearning to create, the form without the content. This soul was Will and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>nothing but Will. It needed an aim for its Columbus-longing; it <em>had</em> to give
its inherent activity at least the illusion of a meaning and an object. And so
the keener critic will find a trace of Hjalmar Ekdal in all modernity, even its
highest phenomena. Ibsen called it the lie of life. There is something of this
lie in the entire intellect of the Western Civilization, so far as this applies itself
to the future of religion, of art or of philosophy, to a social-ethical aim, a
Third Kingdom. For deep down beneath it all is the gloomy feeling, not to be
repressed, that all this hectic zeal is the effort of a soul that may not and cannot
rest to deceive itself. This is the tragic situation—the inversion of the Hamlet
motive—that produced Nietzsche’s strained conception of a “return,” which
nobody really believed but he himself clutched fast lest the feeling of a mission
should slip out of him. This Life’s lie is the foundation of Bayreuth—which
<em>would be</em> something whereas Pergamum <em>was</em> something—and a thread of it runs
through the entire fabric of Socialism, political, economic and ethical, which
forces itself to ignore the annihilating seriousness of its own final implications,
so as to keep alive the illusion of the historical necessity of its own existence.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>IX</h4>

<p class='c018'>It remains, now, to say a word as to the <em>morphology of a history of philosophy</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is no such thing as Philosophy “in itself.” Every Culture has its own
philosophy, which is a part of its total symbolic expression and forms with its
posing of problems and methods of thought an intellectual ornamentation that
is closely related to that of architecture and the arts of form. From the high
and distant standpoint it matters very little what “truths” thinkers have
managed to formulate in words within their respective schools, for, here as in
every great art, it is the schools, conventions and repertory of forms that are
the basic elements. Infinitely more important than the answers are the <em>questions</em>—the
choice of them, the inner form of them. For it is the <em>particular</em> way
in which a macrocosm presents itself to the understanding man of a <em>particular</em>
Culture that determines <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> the whole necessity of asking them, and the way
in which they are asked.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Classical and the Faustian Cultures, and equally the Indian and the
Chinese, have each their proper ways of asking, and further, in <em>each</em> case, all
the great questions have been posed at the very outset. There is no modern
problem that the Gothic did not see and bring into form, no Hellenistic problem
that did not of necessity come up for the old Orphic temple-teachings.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is of no importance whether the subtilizing turn of mind expresses itself
here in oral tradition and there in books, whether such books are personal
creations of an “I” as they are amongst ourselves or anonymous fluid masses of
texts as in India, and whether the result is a set of comprehensible systems or,
as in Egypt, glimpses of the last secrets are veiled in expressions of art and
ritual. Whatever the variations, the general course of philosophies as organisms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>is the same. At the beginning of every springtime period, philosophy,
intimately related to great architecture and religion, is the intellectual echo of
a mighty metaphysical living, and its task is to establish critically the sacred
causality in the world-image seen with the eye of faith.<a id='r453'></a><a href='#f453' class='c019'><sup>[453]</sup></a> The basic distinctions,
not only of science but also of philosophy, are dependent on, not divorced from,
the elements of the corresponding religion. In this springtime, thinkers are,
not merely in spirit but actually in status, <em>priests</em>. Such were the Schoolmen and
the Mystics of the Gothic and the Vedic as of the Homeric<a id='r454'></a><a href='#f454' class='c019'><sup>[454]</sup></a> and the Early-Arabian<a id='r455'></a><a href='#f455' class='c019'><sup>[455]</sup></a>
centuries. With the setting-in of the Late period, and not earlier,
philosophy becomes urban and worldly, frees itself from subservience to religion
and even dares to make that religion itself the object of epistemological criticism.
The great theme of Brahman, Ionic and Baroque philosophies is the
problem of knowing. The urban spirit turns to look at itself, in order to establish
the proposition that there is no higher judgment-seat of knowing beyond
itself, and with that thought draws nearer to higher mathematics and instead
of priests we have men of the world, statesmen and merchants and discoverers,
tested in high places and by high tasks, whose ideas about thought rest upon
deep experience of life. Of such are the series of great thinkers from Thales
to Protagoras and from Bacon to Hume, and the series of pre-Confucian and
pre-Buddha thinkers of whom we hardly know more than the fact that they
existed.</p>

<p class='c001'>At the end of such series stand Kant and Aristotle,<a id='r456'></a><a href='#f456' class='c019'><sup>[456]</sup></a> and after them there set
in the Civilization-philosophies. In every Culture, thought mounts to a
climax, setting the questions at the outset and answering them with ever-increasing
force of intellectual expression—and, as we have said before, ornamental
significance—until exhausted; and then it passes into a decline in which
the problems of knowing are in every respect stale repetitions of no significance.
There is a metaphysical period, originally of a religious and finally of a rationalistic
cast—in which thought and life still contain something of chaos, an
unexploited fund that enables them effectively to create—and an ethical
period in which life itself, now become megalopolitan, appears to call for
inquiry and has to turn the still available remainder of philosophical creative-power
on to its own conduct and maintenance. In the one period life <em>reveals</em>
itself, the other has life as its <em>object</em>. The one is “theoretical” (contemplative)
in the grand sense, the other perforce practical. Even the Kantian system is in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>its deepest characters <em>contemplated</em> in the first instance and <em>only afterwards</em> logically
and systematically formulated and ordered.</p>

<p class='c001'>We see this evidenced in Kant’s attitude to mathematics. No one is a
genuine metaphysician who has not penetrated into the form-world of numbers,
who has not lived them into himself as a symbolism. And in fact it was the
great thinkers of the Baroque who created the analytical mathematic, and the
same is true, <span lang="la"><i>mutatis mutandis</i></span>, of the great pre-Socratics and Plato. Descartes
and Leibniz stand beside Newton and Gauss, Pythagoras and Plato by Archytas
and Archimedes, at the summits of mathematical development. But already in
Kant the philosopher has become, as mathematician, negligible. Kant no more
penetrated to the last subtleties of the Calculus as it stood in his own day than
he absorbed the axiomatic of Leibniz. The same may be said of Aristotle. And
thenceforward there is no philosopher who is counted as a mathematician.
Fichte, Hegel and the Romantics were entirely unmathematical, and so were
Zeno<a id='r457'></a><a href='#f457' class='c019'><sup>[457]</sup></a> and Epicurus. Schopenhauer in this field is weak to the point of crudity,
and of Nietzsche the less said the better. When the form-world of numbers
passed out of its ken, philosophy lost a great convention, and since then it has
lacked not only structural strength but also what may be called the <em>grand style</em>
of thinking. Schopenhauer himself admitted that he was a hand-to-mouth
thinker (<span lang="de"><i>Gelegenheitsdenker</i></span>).</p>

<p class='c001'>With the decline of metaphysics, ethics has outgrown its status as a subordinate
element in abstract theory. Henceforth it <em>is</em> philosophy, the other
divisions being absorbed into it and practical living becoming the centre of
consideration. The passion of pure thought sinks down. Metaphysics, mistress
yesterday, is handmaid now; all it is required to do is to provide a foundation
for practical views. And the foundation becomes more and more
superfluous. It becomes the custom to despise and mock at the metaphysical,
the unpractical, the philosophy of “stone for bread.” In Schopenhauer
it is for the sake of the fourth book that the first three exist at all. Kant
merely <em>thought</em> that it was the same with him; in reality, pure and not applied
reason is still his centre of creation. There is exactly the same difference in
Classical philosophy before and after Aristotle—on the one hand, a grandly
conceived Cosmos to which a <em>formal</em> ethic adds almost nothing, and, on the
other, ethics as such, as programme, as necessity with a desultory <em>ad hoc</em>
metaphysic for basis. And the entire absence of logical scruple with which
Nietzsche, for instance, dashes off such theories makes no difference whatever
to our appreciation of his philosophy proper.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is well known<a id='r458'></a><a href='#f458' class='c019'><sup>[458]</sup></a> that Schopenhauer did not proceed to Pessimism from his
metaphysic but, on the contrary, was led to develop his system by the pessimism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>that fell upon him in his seventeenth year. Shaw, a most significant witness,
observes in his “Quintessence of Ibsenism” that one may quite well accept
Schopenhauer’s philosophy and reject his metaphysics—therein quite accurately
discriminating between that which makes him the first thinker of the
new age and that which is included because an obsolete tradition held it to be
indispensable in a complete philosophy. No one would undertake to divide
Kant thus, and the attempt would not succeed if it were made. But with
Nietzsche one has no difficulty in perceiving that his “philosophy” was
through-and-through an inner and very early experience, while he covered his
metaphysical requirements rapidly and often imperfectly by the aid of a few
books, and never managed to state even his ethical theory with any exactitude.
Just the same overlay of living seasonable ethical thought on a stratum of
metaphysics required by convention (but in fact superfluous) is to be found in
Epicurus and the Stoics. We need have no doubt after this as to what is the
essence of a Civilization-philosophy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Strict metaphysics has exhausted its possibilities. The world-city has definitely
overcome the land, and now its spirit fashions a theory proper to itself,
directed of necessity outward, soulless. Henceforward, we might with some
justice replace the word “soul” by the word “brain.” And, since in the Western
“brain” the will to power, the tyrannical set towards the Future and purpose
to organize everybody and everything, demands practical expression,
ethics, as it loses touch more and more with its metaphysical past, steadily
assumes a <em>social-ethical</em> and <em>social-economic</em> character. The philosophy of the
present that starts from Hegel and Schopenhauer is, so far as it represents the
spirit of the age (which, e.g., Lotze and Herbart do not), a <em>critique of society</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>The attention that the Stoic gave to his own body, the Westerner devotes to
the body social. It is not chance that Hegelian philosophy has given rise to
Socialism (Marx, Engels), to Anarchism (Stirner) and to the problem-posing
social drama (Hebbel). Socialism is political economy converted into the
ethical and, moreover, the <em>imperative</em> mood. So long as a metaphysic existed
(that is, till Kant) political economy remained a science. But as soon as
“philosophy” became synonymous with practical ethics, <em>it replaced mathematics
as the basis of thought about the world</em>—hence the importance of Cousin, Bentham,
Comte, Mill and Spencer.</p>

<p class='c001'>To choose his material at will is not given to the philosopher, neither is the
material of philosophy always and everywhere the same. There are no eternal
questions, but only questions arising out of the feelings of a particular being and
posed by it. <span lang="de"><i>Alles Vergängliche ist nur ein Gleichnis</i></span> applies also to every genuine
philosophy as the intellectual expression of this being, as the actualization of
spiritual possibilities in a form-world of concepts, judgments and thought-structures
comprised in the living phenomenon of its author. Any and every
such philosophy is, from the first word to the last, from its most abstract proposition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>to its most telltale trait of personality, a thing-become, mirrored over
from soul into world, from the realm of freedom into that of necessity, from the
immediate-living into the dimensional-logical; and on that very account it is
mortal, and its life has prescribed rhythm and duration. <i>The choice of them,
therefore, is subject to strict necessity.</i> Each epoch has its own, important for itself
and for no other epoch. It is the mark of the born philosopher that he sees his
epoch and his theme with a sure eye. Apart from this, there is nothing of any
importance in philosophical production—merely technical knowledge and the
industry requisite for the building up of systematic and conceptual subtleties.</p>

<p class='c001'>Consequently, the distinctive philosophy of the 19th Century is <i>only</i> Ethics
and social critique in the productive sense—nothing more. And consequently,
again, its most important representatives (apart from actual practitioners) are
the <i>dramatists</i>. They are the real philosophers of Faustian activism, and compared
with them not one of the lecture-room philosophers and systematics
counts at all. All that these unimportant pedants have done for us is, so to
write and rewrite the history of philosophy (and what history!—collections
of dates and “results”) that no one to-day knows what the history of philosophy
is or what it might be.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thanks to this, the deep organic unity in the thought of this epoch has never
yet been perceived. The essence of it, from the philosophical point of view, can
be precised by asking the question: In how far is Shaw the pupil and fulfiller of
Nietzsche? The question is put in no ironic spirit. Shaw is the one thinker of
eminence who has consistently advanced in the same direction as that of the
true Nietzsche—namely, productive criticism of the Western morale—while
following out as poet the last implications of Ibsen and devoting the balance of
the artistic creativeness that is in him to practical discussions.</p>

<p class='c001'>Save in so far as the belated Romanticist in him has determined the style,
sound and attitude of his philosophy, Nietzsche is in every respect a disciple of
the materialistic decades. That which drew him with such passion to Schopenhauer
was (not that he himself or anyone else was conscious of it) that element
of Schopenhauer’s doctrine by which he destroyed the great metaphysic and
(without meaning to do so) parodied his master Kant; that is to say, the modification
of all deep ideas of the Baroque age into tangible and mechanistic
notions. Kant speaks in inadequate words, which hide a mighty and scarcely
apprehensible intuition, an intuition of the world as appearance or phenomenon.
In Schopenhauer this becomes the world as brain-phenomenon
(Gehirnphänomen). The change-over from tragic philosophy to philosophical
plebeianism is complete. It will be enough to cite one passage. In “The
World as Will and Idea” Schopenhauer says: “The will, as thing-in-itself,
constitutes the inner, true and indestructible essence of the man; in itself, however,
it is without consciousness. For the consciousness is conditioned by the
intellect and this is a mere accident of our being, since it is a function of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>brain, and that again (with its dependent nerves and spinal cord) is a mere
fruit, a product, nay, even a parasite of the rest of the organism, inasmuch as
it does not intervene directly in the latter’s activities but only serves a purpose
of self-preservation by regulating its relations with the outer world.” Here
we have exactly the fundamental position of the flattest materialism. It was
not for nothing that Schopenhauer, like Rousseau before him, studied the
English sensualists. From them he learned to misread Kant in the spirit of
megalopolitan utilitarian modernity. The intellect as instrument of the will-to-life,<a id='r459'></a><a href='#f459' class='c019'><sup>[459]</sup></a>
as weapon in the struggle for existence, the ideas brought to grotesque
expression by Shaw in “Man and Superman”—it was because this was his
view of the world that Schopenhauer became the fashionable philosopher
when Darwin’s main work was published in 1859. In contrast to Schelling,
Hegel and Fichte, he was a philosopher, and the only philosopher, whose
metaphysical propositions could be absorbed with ease by intellectual mediocrity.
The clarity of which he was so proud threatened at every moment
to reveal itself as triviality. While retaining enough of formula to produce
an atmosphere of profundity and exclusiveness, he presented the civilized
view of the world complete and assimilable. His system is <i>anticipated Darwinism</i>,
and the speech of Kant and the concepts of the Indians are simply
clothing. In his book <span lang="la">“Ueber den Willen in der Natur”</span> (1835) we find
already the struggle for self-preservation in Nature, the human intellect as
master-weapon in that struggle and sexual love as unconscious selection according
to biological interest.<a id='r460'></a><a href='#f460' class='c019'><sup>[460]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It is the view that Darwin (via Malthus) brought to bear with irresistible
success in the field of zoology. The economic origin of Darwinism is shown by
the fact that the system deduced from the similarities between men and the
higher animals ceases to fit even at the level of the plant-world and becomes
positively absurd as soon as it is seriously attempted to apply it with its will-tendency
(natural selection, mimicry) to primitive organic forms.<a id='r461'></a><a href='#f461' class='c019'><sup>[461]</sup></a> Proof, to
the Darwinian, means to the ordering and pictorial presentation of a selection
of facts so that they conform to his historico-dynamic basic feeling of “Evolution.”
Darwinism—that is to say, that totality of very varied and discrepant
ideas, in which the common factor is merely the application of the causality
principle to living things, which therefore is a <i>method and not a result</i>—was
known in all details to the 18th Century. Rousseau was championing the ape-man
theory as early as 1754. What Darwin originated is only the “Manchester
School” system, and it is this <i>latent political element in it that accounts for its
popularity</i>.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>The spiritual unity of the century is manifest enough here. From Schopenhauer
to Shaw, everyone has been, without being aware of it, bringing the same
principle into form. Everyone (including even those who, like Hebbel, knew
nothing of Darwin) is a derivative of the evolution-idea—and of the shallow
civilized and not the deep Goethian form of it at that—whether he issues it
with a biological or an economic imprint. There is evolution, too, in the
evolution-idea itself, which is Faustian through and through, which displays
(in sharpest contrast to Aristotle’s timeless entelechy-idea) all our passionate
urgency towards infinite future, our <i>will</i> and sense of <i>aim</i> which is so immanent
in, so specific to, the Faustian spirit as to be the <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> form rather than the
discovered principle of our Nature-picture. And in the evolution of evolution
we find the same change taking place as elsewhere, the turn of the Culture to
the Civilization. In Goethe evolution is upright, in Darwin it is flat; in Goethe
organic, in Darwin mechanical; in Goethe an experience and emblem, in Darwin
a matter of cognition and law. To Goethe evolution meant inward fulfilment,
to Darwin it meant “Progress.” Darwin’s struggle for existence, which he read
<em>into</em> Nature and not out of it, is only the plebeian form of that primary feeling
which in Shakespeare’s tragedies moves the great realities against one another;
but what Shakespeare inwardly saw, felt and actualized in his figures as destiny,
Darwinism comprehends as causal connexion and formulates as a superficial system
of utilities. And it is this system and not this primary feeling that is the
basis of the utterances of “Zarathustra,” the tragedy of “Ghosts,” the problems
of the “Ring of the Nibelungs.” Only, it was with terror that Schopenhauer,
the first of his line, perceived what his own knowledge meant—that is
the root of his pessimism, and the “Tristan” music of his adherent Wagner is its
highest expression—whereas the late men, and foremost among them Nietzsche,
face it with enthusiasm, though it is true, the enthusiasm is sometimes
rather forced.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nietzsche’s breach with Wagner—that last product of the German spirit
over which greatness broods—marks his silent change of school-allegiance,
his unconscious step from Schopenhauer to Darwin, from the metaphysical to
the physiological formulation of the same world-feeling, from the denial to the
affirmation of the aspect that in fact is common to <em>both</em>, the one seeing as will-to-life
what the other regards as struggle for existence. In his <span lang="de">“Schopenhauer
als Erzieher”</span> he still means by evolution an inner ripening, but the Superman
is the product of evolution as machinery. And “Zarathustra” is <em>ethically</em> the
outcome of an unconscious protest against “Parsifal”—which <em>artistically</em>
entirely governs it—of the rivalry of one evangelist for another.</p>

<p class='c001'>But Nietzsche was also a Socialist without knowing it. Not his catchwords,
but his instincts, were Socialistic, practical, directed to that welfare of
mankind that Goethe and Kant never spent a thought upon. Materialism, Socialism
and Darwinism are only artificially and on the surface separable. It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>this that made it possible for Shaw in the third act of “Man and Superman”
(one of the most important and significant of the works that issued from the
transition) to obtain, by giving just a small and indeed perfectly logical turn
to the tendencies of “master-morale” and the production of the Superman, the
specific maxims of <em>his own</em> Socialism. Here Shaw was only expressing with remorseless
clarity and full consciousness of the commonplace, what the uncompleted
portion of the Zarathustra would have said with Wagnerian theatricality
and woolly romanticism. All that we are concerned to discover in Nietzsche’s
reasoning is its <em>practical</em> bases and consequences, which proceed of necessity from
the structure of modern public life. He moves amongst vague ideas like “new
values,” “Superman,” <span lang="la">“Sinn der Erde,”</span> and declines or fears to shape them
more precisely. Shaw does it. Nietzsche observes that the Darwinian idea of
the Superman evokes the notion of breeding, and stops there, leaves it at a
sounding phrase. Shaw pursues the question—for there is no object in talking
about it if nothing is going to be <em>done</em> about it—asks how it is to be achieved,
and from that comes to demand the transformation of mankind into a stud-farm.
But this is merely the conclusion implicit in the Zarathustra, which Nietzsche
was not bold enough, or was too fastidious, to draw. If we <em>do</em> talk of systematic
breeding—a completely materialistic and utilitarian notion—we must be
prepared to answer the questions, who shall breed what, where and how? But
Nietzsche, too romantic to face the very prosaic social consequences and to expose
poetic ideas to the test of facts, omits to say that his whole doctrine, as a
derivative of Darwinism, presupposes Socialism and, moreover, socialistic <em>compulsion</em>
as the <em>means</em>; that any systematic breeding of a class of higher men requires
as condition precedent a strictly socialistic ordering of society; and that
this “Dionysiac” idea, as it involves a <em>common</em> action and is not simply the
private affair of detached thinkers, is democratic, turn it how you may. It is
the climax of the ethical force of “Thou shalt”; to impose upon the world the
form of his will, Faustian man sacrifices even himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>The breeding of the Superman follows from the notion of “selection.”
Nietzsche was an unconscious pupil of Darwin from the time that he wrote
aphorisms, but Darwin himself had remoulded the evolution-ideas of the 18th
Century according to the Malthusian tendencies of political economy, which
he projected on the higher animal-world. Malthus had studied the cotton
industry in Lancashire, and already in 1857 we have the whole system, only
applied to men instead of to beasts, in Buckle’s History of English Civilization.</p>

<p class='c001'>In other words, the “master-morale” of this last of the Romantics is derived—strangely
perhaps but very significantly—from that source of all intellectual
modernity, the atmosphere of the English factory. The Machiavellism that
commended itself to Nietzsche as a Renaissance phenomenon is something
closely (one would have supposed, obviously) akin to Darwin’s notion of
“mimicry.” It is in fact that of which Marx (that other famous disciple of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>Malthus) treats in his <span lang="de"><cite>Das Kapital</cite></span>, the bible of political (not ethical) Socialism.<a id='r462'></a><a href='#f462' class='c019'><sup>[462]</sup></a>
That is the genealogy of <span lang="la">“Herrenmoral.”</span> The Will-to-Power, transferred
to the realistic, political and economic domain, finds its expression in
Shaw’s “Major Barbara.” No doubt Nietzsche, as a personality, stands at the
culmination of this series of ethical philosophers, but here Shaw the party politician
reaches up to his level as a thinker. The will-to-power is to-day represented
by the two poles of public life—the worker-class and the big money-and-brain
men—far more effectually than it ever was by a Borgia. The
millionaire Undershaft of Shaw’s best comedy is a Superman, though Nietzsche
the Romanticist would not have recognized his ideal in such a figure. Nietzsche
is for ever speaking of transvaluations of all values, of a philosophy of the “Future”
(which, incidentally, is merely the Western, and not the Chinese or the
African future), but when the mists of his thought do come in from the Dionysiac
distance and condense into any tangible form, the will-to-power appears to
him in the guise of dagger-and-poison and never in that of strike and “deal.”
And yet he says that the idea first came to him when he saw the Prussian regiments
marching to battle in 1870.</p>

<p class='c001'>The drama, in this epoch, is no longer poetry in the old sense of the Culture
days, but a form of agitation, debate and demonstration. The stage has become
a moralizing institution. Nietzsche himself often thought of putting his ideas
in the dramatic form. Wagner’s Nibelung poetry, more especially the first
draft of it (1850), expresses his social-revolutionary ideas, and even when, after
a circuitous course under influences artistic and non-artistic, he has completed
the “Ring,” his Siegfried is still a symbol of the Fourth Estate, his Brünhilde
still the “free woman.” The sexual selection of which the “Origin of Species”
enunciated the theory in 1859, was finding its musical expression at the very
same time in the third act of “Siegfried” and in “Tristan.” It is no accident
that Wagner, Hebbel and Ibsen, all practically simultaneously, set to work to
dramatize the Nibelung material. Hebbel, making the acquaintance in Paris of
Engels’s writings, expresses (in a letter of April 2, 1844) his surprise at finding
that his own conceptions of the social principle of his age, which he was then
intending to exemplify in a drama <span lang="de"><cite>Zu irgend einer Zeit</cite></span>, coincided precisely with
those of the future “Communist Manifesto.” And, upon first making the
acquaintance of Schopenhauer (letter of March 19, 1857), he is equally surprised
by the affinity that he finds between the <span lang="de"><cite>Welt als Wille und Vorstellung</cite></span> and tendencies
upon which he had based his Holofernes and his <span lang="de"><cite>Herodes und Mariamne</cite></span>.
Hebbel’s diaries, of which the most important portion belongs to the years 1835-1845,
were (though he did not know it) one of the deepest philosophical efforts
of the century. It would be no surprise to find whole sentences of it in Nietzsche,
who never knew him and did not always come up to his level.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>The <em>actual and effective</em> philosophy of the 19th Century, then, has as its one
genuine theme the Will-to-Power. It considers this Will-to-Power in civilized-intellectual,
ethical, or social forms and presents it as will-to-life, as life-force,
as practical-dynamical principle, as idea, and as dramatic figure. (The period
that is <em>closed</em> by Shaw corresponds to the period 350-250 in the Classical.) The
rest of the 19th-Century philosophy is, to use Schopenhauer’s phrase, “professors’
philosophy by philosophy-professors.” The real landmarks are these:</p>

<p class='c009'>With this, the ethical period exhausts itself as the metaphysical had done.
Ethical Socialism, prepared by Fichte, Hegel, and Humboldt, was at its zenith
of passionate greatness about the middle of the 19th Century, and at the end
thereof it had reached the stage of repetitions. The 20th Century, while keeping
the <em>word</em> Socialism, has replaced an ethical philosophy that only Epigoni suppose
to be capable of further development, by a praxis of economic everyday
questions. The ethical disposition of the West will remain “socialistic” but
its theory has ceased to be a problem. And there remains the possibility of a
third and last stage of Western philosophy, that of a physiognomic scepticism.
The secret of the world appears successively as a knowledge problem, a valuation
problem and a form problem. Kant saw Ethics as an object of knowledge,
the 19th Century saw it as an object of valuation. The Sceptic would deal with
<em>both</em> simply as the historical expression of a Culture.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>I</h3>

<p class='c018'>Helmholtz observed, in a lecture of 1869 that has become famous, that “the
final aim of Natural Science is to discover the motions underlying all alteration,
and the motive forces thereof; that is, to resolve itself into Mechanics.” What
this resolution into mechanics means is the reference of all qualitative impressions
to fixed quantitative base-values, that is, to the <em>extended</em> and to <em>change of
place</em> therein. It means, further—if we bear in mind the opposition of becoming
and become, form and law, image and notion—the referring of the seen
Nature-picture to the imagined picture of a single numerically and structurally
measurable Order. The specific tendency of all Western mechanics is towards
an intellectual <em>conquest by measurement</em>, and it is therefore obliged to look for
the essence of the phenomenon in a system of constant elements that are susceptible
of full and inclusive appreciation by measurement, of which Helmholtz
distinguishes <em>motion</em> (using the word in its everyday sense) as the most
important.</p>

<p class='c001'>To the physicist this definition appears unambiguous and exhaustive, but
to the sceptic who has followed out the history of this scientific conviction, it
is very far from being either. To the physicist, present-day mechanics is a
logical system of clear, uniquely-significant concepts and of simple, necessary
relations; while to the other it is a <em>picture</em> distinctive of the structure of the
West-European spirit, though he admits that the picture is consistent in the
highest degree and most impressively convincing. It is self-evident that no
<em>practical</em> results and discoveries can prove anything as to the “truth” of the
<em>theory</em>, the <em>picture</em>.<a id='r463'></a><a href='#f463' class='c019'><sup>[463]</sup></a> For most people, indeed, “mechanics” appears as the self-evident
synthesis of Nature-impressions. But it merely appears to be so. For
what is motion? Is not the postulate that everything qualitative is reducible
to the motion of unalterably-alike mass-points, essentially Faustian and not
common to humanity? Archimedes, for example, did not feel himself obliged to
transpose the mechanics that he saw into a mental picture of motions. Is motion
generally a purely mechanical quantity? Is it a word for a visual experience
or is it a notion derived from that experience? Is it the number that is found by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>measurement of experimentally-produced facts, or the picture that is subjected
to that number, that is signified by it? And if one day physics should really
succeed in reaching its supposed aim, in devising a system of law-governed
“motions” and of efficient forces behind them into which everything whatsoever
appreciable by the senses could be fitted—would it thereby have achieved
“knowledge” of that which occurs, or even made one step towards this
achievement? Yet is the form-language of mechanics one whit the less dogmatic
on that account? Is it not, on the contrary, a vessel of the myth like the root-words,
not proceeding from experience but shaping it and, in this case, shaping
it with all possible rigour? What is force? What is a cause? What is a process?
Nay, even on the basis of its own definitions, has physics a specific problem at
all? Has it an object that counts as such for all the centuries? Has it even one
unimpeachable imagination-unit, with reference to which it may express its
results?</p>

<p class='c001'>The answer may be anticipated. Modern physics, as a science, is an immense
system of <em>indices</em> in the form of names and numbers whereby we are enabled to
work with Nature as with a machine.<a id='r464'></a><a href='#f464' class='c019'><sup>[464]</sup></a> As such, it may have an exactly-definable
end. But as a piece of <em>history</em>, all made up of destinies and incidents
in the lives of the men who have worked in it and in the course of research itself,
physics is, in point of object, methods and results alike an expression and
actualization of a Culture, an organic and evolving element in the essence of
that Culture, and every one of its results is a symbol. That which physics—which
exists only in the waking-consciousness of the Culture-man—thinks
it finds in its methods and in its results was already there, underlying and implicit
in, the choice and manner of its search. Its discoveries, in virtue of their
imagined content (as distinguished from their printable formulæ), have been of
a purely mythic nature, even in minds so prudent as those of J. B. Mayer, Faraday
and Hertz. In every Nature-law, physically exact as it may be, we are called
upon to distinguish between the nameless number and the naming of it, between
the plain fixation of limits<a id='r465'></a><a href='#f465' class='c019'><sup>[465]</sup></a> and their theoretical interpretation. The formulæ
represent general logical values, pure numbers—that is to say, objective space—and
boundary-elements. But formulæ are dumb. The expression <i>s</i> = ½<i>gt</i>²
means nothing at all unless one is able mentally to connect the letters with
particular words and their symbolism. But the moment we clothe the dead
signs in such words, give them flesh, body and life, and, in sum, a perceptible
significance in the world, we have overstepped the limits of a mere <em>order</em>.
θεωρία means image, vision, and it is this that makes a Nature-law out of a
figure-and-letter formula. Everything exact is in itself <em>meaningless</em>, and every
physical observation is so constituted that it <em>proves the basis of a certain number of
imaged presuppositions</em>; and the effect of its successful issue is to make these presuppositions
more convincing than ever. Apart from these, the result consists
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>merely of empty figures. But in fact we do not and cannot get apart from them.
Even if an investigator puts on one side every hypothesis that he knows as such,
as soon as he sets his <em>thought</em> to work on the supposedly clear task, he is not
controlling but being controlled by the unconscious form of it, for in living
activity he is always a man of his Culture, of his age, of his school and of his
tradition. Faith and “knowledge” are only two species of inner certitude, but
of the two faith is the older and it dominates all the conditions of knowing,
be they never so exact. And thus it is theories and not pure numbers that are
the support of all natural science. The unconscious longing for that genuine
science which (be it repeated) is peculiar to the spirit of Culture-man sets itself
to apprehend, to penetrate, and to comprise within its grasp the world-image
of Nature. Mere industrious measuring for measuring’s sake is not and never
has been more than a delight for little minds. Numbers may only be the key of
the secret, no more. No significant man would ever have spent himself on them
for their own sake.</p>

<p class='c001'>Kant, it is true, says in a well-known passage: “I maintain that in each
and every discipline of natural philosophy it is only possible to find as much
of true science as is to be found of mathematics therein.” What Kant has in
mind here is pure delimitation in the field of the become, so far as law and formula,
number and system can (at any particular stage) be seen in that field.
But a law without words, a law, consisting merely of a series of figures read off
an instrument, cannot even as an intellectual operation be completely effective in
this pure state. Every savant’s experiment, be it what it may, is at the same
time an instance of the <em>kind</em> of symbolism that rules in the savant’s ideation.
All Laws formulated in words are Orders that have been activated and vitalized,
filled with the very essence of the one—and only the one—Culture. As to
the “necessity” which is a postulate in all exact research, here too we have to
consider two kinds of necessity, viz., a necessity within the spiritual and living
(for it is Destiny that the history of every individual research-act takes its course
when, where and how it does) and a necessity within the known (for which
the current Western name is Causality). If the pure numbers of a physical
formula represent a causal necessity, the existence, the birth and the life-duration
of a theory are a Destiny.</p>

<p class='c001'>Every fact, even the simplest, contains <span lang="la"><i>ab initio</i></span> a theory. A fact is a
uniquely-occurring impression upon a waking being, and everything depends on
whether that being, the being for whom it occurs or did occur, is or was Classical
or Western, Gothic or Baroque. Compare the effect produced by a flash of
lightning on a sparrow and on an alert physical investigator, and think how
much more is contained in the observer’s “fact” than in the sparrow’s. The
modern physicist is too ready to forget that even words like quantity, position,
process, change of state and body represent specifically Western images. These
words excite and these images mirror a feeling of significances, too subtle for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>verbal description, incommunicable to Classical or to Magian or to other mankind
as like subtleties of their thought and feeling are incommunicable to us.
And the character of scientific facts as such—that is, the mode of their becoming
known—is completely governed by this feeling; and if so, then also <span lang="la"><i>a
fortiori</i></span> such intricate intellectual notions as work, tension, quantity of energy,
quantity of heat, probability,<a id='r466'></a><a href='#f466' class='c019'><sup>[466]</sup></a> every one of which contains a veritable scientific
myth of its own. We think of such conceptual images as ensuing from quite
unprejudiced research and, subject to certain conditions, definitively valid.
But a first-rate scientist of the time of Archimedes would have declared himself,
after a thorough study of our modern theoretical physics, quite unable to comprehend
how anyone could assert such arbitrary, grotesque and involved notions
to be Science, still less how they could be claimed as necessary consequences
from actual facts. “The scientifically-justified conclusions,” he would
have said, “are really so-and-so”; and thereupon he would have evolved, on
the basis of the same elements made “facts” by <em>his</em> eyes and <em>his</em> mind, theories
that our physicists would listen to with amazed ridicule.</p>

<p class='c001'>For what, after all, are the basic notions that have been evolved with inward
certainty of logic in the field of our physics? Polarized light-rays, errant ions,
flying and colliding gas-particles, magnetic fields, electric currents and waves—are
they not one and all Faustian visions, closely akin to Romanesque ornamentation,
the upthrust of Gothic architecture, the Viking’s voyaging into
unknown seas, the longings of Columbus and Copernicus? Did not this world
of forms and pictures grow up in perfect tune with the contemporary arts of
perspective oil-painting and instrumental music? Are they not, in short, our
passionate directedness, our passion of the third dimension, coming to symbolic
expression in the imagined Nature-picture as in the soul-image?</p>

<h4 class='c021'>II</h4>

<p class='c018'>It follows then that all “knowing” of Nature, even the exactest, is based on
a religious faith. The pure mechanics that the physicist has set before himself
as the end-form to which it is his task (and the purpose of all this imagination-machinery)
to reduce Nature, presupposes a <em>dogma</em>—namely, the religious
world-picture of the Gothic centuries. For it is from this world-picture that
the physics peculiar to the Western intellect is derived. There is no science that
is without unconscious presuppositions of this kind, over which the researcher
has no control and which can be traced back to the earliest days of the awakening
Culture. <em>There is no Natural science without a precedent Religion.</em> In this point
there is no distinction between the Catholic and the Materialistic views of the
world—both say the same thing in different words. Even atheistic science
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>has religion; modern mechanics exactly reproduces the contemplativeness of
Faith.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the Ionic reaches its height in Thales or the Baroque in Bacon, and
man has come to the urban stage of his career, his self-assurance begins to look
upon critical science, in contrast to the more primitive religion of the countryside,
as the superior attitude towards things, and, holding as he thinks the only
key to real knowledge, to explain religion itself empirically and psychologically—in
other words, to “conquer” it with the rest. Now, the history of the
higher Cultures shows that “science” is a transitory spectacle,<a id='r467'></a><a href='#f467' class='c019'><sup>[467]</sup></a> belonging only
to the autumn and winter of their life-course, and that in the cases of the
Classical, the Indian, the Chinese and the Arabian thought alike a few centuries
suffice for the complete exhaustion of its possibilities. Classical science
faded out between the battle of Cannæ and that of Actium and made way for
the world-outlook of the “second religiousness.”<a id='r468'></a><a href='#f468' class='c019'><sup>[468]</sup></a> And from this it is possible
to foresee a date at which our Western scientific thought shall have reached the
limit of its evolution.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is no justification for assigning to this intellectual form-world the
primacy over others. Every critical science, like every myth and every religious
belief, rests upon an inner certitude. Various as the creatures of this certitude
may be, both in structure and in sound, they are not different in basic principle.
Any reproach, therefore, levelled by Natural science at Religion is a boomerang.
We are presumptuous and no less in supposing that we can ever set up “The
Truth” in the place of “anthropomorphic” conceptions, for no other conceptions
but these exist at all. Every idea that is possible at all is a mirror of the
being of its author. The statement that “man created God in his own image,”
valid for every historical religion, is not less valid for every physical theory,
however firm its reputed basis of fact. Classical scientists conceived of light as
consisting in corporeal particles proceeding from the source of light to the eye
of the beholder. For the Arabian thought, even at the stage of the Jewish-Persian
academies of Edessa, Resaïna and Pombaditha (and for Porphyry too),
the colours and forms of things were evidenced without the intervention of a
medium, being brought in a magic and “spiritual” way to the seeing-power
which was conceived as substantial and resident in the eyeball. This was the
doctrine<a id='r469'></a><a href='#f469' class='c019'><sup>[469]</sup></a> taught by Ibn-al-Haitan, by Avicenna and by the “Brothers of
Sincerity.”<a id='r470'></a><a href='#f470' class='c019'><sup>[470]</sup></a> And the idea of light as a force, an <em>impetus</em>, was current even from
about 1300 amongst the Paris Occamists who centred on Albert of Saxony,
Buridan and Oresme the discoverer of co-ordinate geometry. Each Culture has
made its own set of images of processes, which are true only for itself and only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>alive while it is itself alive and actualizing its possibilities. When a Culture
is at its end and the creative element—the imaginative power, the symbolism—is
extinct, there are left “empty” formulæ, skeletons of dead systems, which
men of another Culture read literally, feel to be without meaning or value and
either mechanically store up or else despise and forget. Numbers, formulæ,
laws <em>mean</em> nothing and <em>are</em> nothing. They must have a body, and only a <em>living</em>
mankind—projecting its livingness into them and through them, expressing
itself by them, inwardly making them its own—can endow them with that.
And thus there is no absolute science of physics, but only individual sciences
that come, flourish and go within the individual Cultures.</p>

<p class='c001'>The “Nature” of Classical man found its highest artistic emblem in the
nude statue, and out of it logically there grew up a <em>static of bodies, a physics of
the near</em>. The Arabian Culture owned the arabesque and the cavern-vaulting of
the mosque, and out of this world-feeling there issued <em>Alchemy</em> with its ideas of
mysterious efficient substantialities like the “philosophical mercury,” which
is neither a material nor a property but some thing that underlies the coloured
existence of metals and can transmute one metal into another.<a id='r471'></a><a href='#f471' class='c019'><sup>[471]</sup></a> And the outcome
of Faustian man’s Nature idea was <em>a dynamic of unlimited span, a physics
of the distant</em>. To the Classical therefore belong the conceptions of <em>matter and
form</em>, to the Arabian (quite Spinozistically) the idea of <em>substances</em> with visible
or secret <em>attributes</em>,<a id='r472'></a><a href='#f472' class='c019'><sup>[472]</sup></a> and to the Faustian the idea of <em>force and mass</em>. Apollinian
theory is a quiet meditation, Magian a silent knowledge of Alchemy the means
of Grace (even here the religious source of mechanics is to be discerned), and the
Faustian is from the very outset a <em>working hypothesis</em>.<a id='r473'></a><a href='#f473' class='c019'><sup>[473]</sup></a> The Greek asked, what
is the essence of visible being? We ask, what possibility is there of mastering
the invisible motive-forces of becoming? For them, contented absorption in
the visible; for us, masterful questioning of Nature and methodical experiment.</p>

<p class='c001'>As with the formulation of problems and the methods of dealing with them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>so also with the basic concepts. They are symbols in each case of the one
and only the one Culture. The Classical root-words ἄπειρον, ἀρχή, μορφή, ὕλη,
are not translatable into our speech. To render ἀρχή by “prime-stuff” is to
eliminate its Apollinian connotation, to make the hollow shell of the word
sound an alien note. That which Classical man saw before him as “motion”
in space, he understood as ἀλλοίωσις, change of position of bodies; we, from
the way in which we experience motion, have deduced the concept of a <em>process</em>,
a “going forward,” thereby expressing and emphasizing that element of
directional energy which our thought necessarily predicates in the courses of
Nature. The Classical critic of Nature took the visible juxtaposition of states
as the original diversity, and specified the famous four elements of Empedocles—namely,
earth as the rigid-corporeal, water as the non-rigid-corporeal and
air as the incorporeal, together with fire, which is so much the strongest of all
optical impressions that the Classical spirit could have no doubt of its bodiliness.
The Arabian “elements,” on the contrary, are ideal and implicit in the
secret constitutions and constellations which define the phenomenon of things
for the eye. If we try to get a little nearer to this feeling, we shall find that the
opposition of rigid and fluid means something quite different for the Syrian from
what it means for the Aristotelian Greek, the latter seeing in it different degrees
of bodiliness and the former different magic attributes. With the former therefore
arises the image of the <em>chemical</em> element as a sort of magic substance that a
secret causality makes to appear out of things (and to vanish into them again)
and which is subject even to the influence of the stars. In Alchemy there is deep
scientific doubt as to the plastic actuality of things—of the “somata” of
Greek mathematicians, physicists and poets—and it dissolves and destroys the
soma in the hope of finding its essence. It is an iconoclastic movement just as
truly as those of Islam and the Byzantine Bogomils were so. It reveals a deep
disbelief in the tangible figure of phenomenal Nature, the figure of her that to
the Greek was sacrosanct. The conflict concerning the person of Christ which
manifested itself in all the early Councils and led to the Nestorian and Monophysite
secessions is an <em>alchemistic</em> problem.<a id='r474'></a><a href='#f474' class='c019'><sup>[474]</sup></a> It would never have occurred to a
Classical physicist to investigate things while at the same time denying or
annihilating their perceivable form. And for that very reason there was no
Classical chemistry, any more than there was any theorizing on the substance
as against the manifestations of Apollo.</p>

<p class='c001'>The rise of a chemical method of the Arabian style betokens a new world-consciousness.
The discovery of it, which at one blow made an end of Apollinian
natural science, of mechanical statics, is linked with the enigmatic name of
Hermes Trismegistus,<a id='r475'></a><a href='#f475' class='c019'><sup>[475]</sup></a> who is supposed to have lived in Alexandria <em>at the same
time as Plotinus and Diophantus</em>. Similarly it was just at the time of the definite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>emancipation of the Western mathematic by Newton and Leibniz that the
Western chemistry<a id='r476'></a><a href='#f476' class='c019'><sup>[476]</sup></a> was freed from Arabic form by Stahl (1660-1734) and his
Phlogiston theory. Chemistry and mathematic alike became pure analysis.
Already Paracelsus (1493-1541) had transformed the Magian effort to make gold
into a pharmaceutical science—a transformation in which one cannot but
surmise an altered world-feeling. Then Robert Boyle (1626-1691) devised the
analytical method and <em>with it the Western conception of the Element</em>. But the
ensuing changes must not be misinterpreted. That which is called the founding
of modern chemistry and has Stahl and Lavoisier at its turning-points is anything
but a building-up of “chemical” ideas, in so far as chemistry implies the
alchemistic outlook on Nature. It is in fact the <em>end</em> of genuine chemistry, its
dissolution into the comprehensive system of pure dynamic, its assimilation
into the mechanical outlook which the Baroque age had established through
Galileo and Newton. The elements of Empedocles designate states of bodiliness
(bezeichnen ein körperliches Sichverhalten) but the elements of Lavoisier,
whose combustion-theory followed promptly upon the isolation of oxygen in
1771, designate energy-systems accessible to human will, “rigid” and “fluid”
becoming mere terms to describe tension-relations between molecules. By our
analysis and synthesis, Nature is not merely asked or persuaded but forced.
The modern chemistry is a chapter of the modern physics of Deed.</p>

<p class='c001'>What we call Statics, Chemistry and Dynamics—words that as used in
modern science are merely traditional distinctions without deeper meaning—are
really the <em>respective physical systems of the Apollinian, Magian and Faustian
souls</em>, each of which grew up in its own Culture and was limited as to validity
to the same. Corresponding to these sciences, each to each, we have the mathematics
of Euclidean geometry, Algebra and Higher Analysis, and the arts of
statue, arabesque and fugue. We may differentiate these three kinds of physics
(bearing in mind of course that other Cultures may and in fact do give rise to
other kinds) by their standpoints towards the problem of motion, and call
them mechanical orderings of states, secret forces and processes respectively.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>III</h4>

<p class='c018'>Now, the tendency of human thought (which is always causally disposed)
to reduce the image of Nature to the simplest possible quantitative form-units
that can be got by causal reasoning, measuring and counting—in a word, by
mechanical differentiation—leads necessarily in Classical, Western and every
other possible physics, to an atomic theory. Of Indian and Chinese science we
know hardly more than the fact they once existed, and the Arabian is so complicated
that even now it seems to defy presentation. But we do know our own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>and the Apollinian sciences well enough to observe, here too, a deeply symbolical
opposition.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Classical atoms are <em>miniature forms</em>, the Western <em>minimal quanta</em>, and
quanta, too, of energy. On the one hand perceptibility, sensuous nearness, and
on the other, abstractness are the basic conditions of the idea. The atomistic
notions of modern physics—which include not only the Daltonian or “chemical”
atom but also the electrons<a id='r477'></a><a href='#f477' class='c019'><sup>[477]</sup></a> and the quanta of thermodynamics—make
more and more demands upon that truly Faustian power of <em>inner vision</em> which
many branches of higher mathematics (such as the Non-Euclidean geometries
and the Theory of Groups) postulate, and which is not at the disposal of laymen.
A quantum of action is an extension-element conceived without regard to
sensible quality of any kind, which eludes all relation with sight and touch, for
which the expression “shape” has no meaning whatever—something therefore
which would be utterly inconceivable to a Classical researcher. Such,
already, were Leibniz’s “Monads”<a id='r478'></a><a href='#f478' class='c019'><sup>[478]</sup></a> and such, superlatively, are the constituents
of Rutherford’s picture of the atom as positively-charged nucleus
with planetary negative electrons, and of the picture that Niels Bohr has imagined
by working these in with the “quanta” of Planck.<a id='r479'></a><a href='#f479' class='c019'><sup>[479]</sup></a> The atoms of
Leucippus and Democritus were different in form and magnitude, that is to say,
they were purely plastic units, “indivisible,” as their name asserts, but only
plastically indivisible. The atoms of Western physics, for which “indivisibility”
has quite another meaning, resemble the figures and themes of music;
their being or essence consisting in vibration and radiation, and their relation
to the processes of Nature being that of the “motive” to the “movement.”<a id='r480'></a><a href='#f480' class='c019'><sup>[480]</sup></a>
Classical physics examines the aspect, Western the working, of these ultimate
elements in the picture of the Become; in the one, the basic notions are notions
of stuff and form, in the other they are notions of capacity and intensity.</p>

<p class='c001'><em>There is a Stoicism and there is a Socialism of the atom</em>, the words describing
the static-plastic and the dynamic-contrapuntal ideas of it respectively. The
relations of these ideas to the images of the corresponding ethics is such that
every law and every definition takes these into account. On the one hand—Democritus’s
multitude of confused atoms, put there, patient, knocked about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>by the blind chance that he as well as Sophocles called ἀνάγκη, hunted like
Œdipus. On the other hand—systems of abstract force-points working in
unison, aggressive, energetically dominating space (as “field”), overcoming
resistances like Macbeth. The opposition of basic feelings makes that of the
mechanical Nature-pictures. According to Leucippus the atoms fly about in
the void “of themselves”; Democritus merely regards shock and countershock
as a form of change of place. Aristotle explains individual movements as accidental,
Empedocles speaks of love and hate, Anaxagoras of meetings and partings.
All these are elements also of Classical tragedy; the figures on the Attic
stage are related to one another just so. Further, and logically, they are the
elements of Classical politics. There we have minute cities, political atoms
ranged along coasts and on islands, each jealously standing for itself, yet ever
needing support, shut-in and shy to the point of absurdity, buffeted hither and
thither by the planless orderless happenings of Classical history, rising to-day
and ruined to-morrow. And in contrast—the dynastic states of our 17th and
18th Centuries, political fields of force, with cabinets and great diplomats as
effective centres of purposeful direction and comprehensive vision. The spirit
of Classical history and the spirit of Western history can only be really understood
by considering the two souls as an opposition. And we can say the same
of the atom-idea, regarded as the basis of the respective physics. Galileo who
created the concept of force and the Milesians who created that of ἀρχή, Democritus
and Leibniz, Archimedes and Helmholtz, are “contemporaries,” members
of the same intellectual phases of quite different Cultures.</p>

<p class='c001'>But the inner relationship between atom-theory and ethic goes further. It
has been shown how the Faustian soul—whose being consists in the overcoming
of presence, whose feeling is loneliness and whose yearning is infinity—puts
its need of solitude, distance and abstraction into all its actualities, into
its public life, its spiritual and its artistic form-worlds alike. This pathos of
distance (to use Nietzsche’s expression) is peculiarly alien to the Classical, in
which everything human demanded nearness, support and community. It is this
that distinguishes the spirit of the Baroque from that of the Ionic, the culture
of the Ancien Régime from that of Periclean Athens. And this pathos, which
distinguishes the heroic doer from the heroic sufferer, appears also in the picture
of Western physics as <em>tension</em>. It is tension that is missing in the science of
Democritus; for in the principle of shock and countershock it is denied by implication
that there is a force commanding space and identical with space.
And, correspondingly, the element of Will is absent from the Classical soul-image.
Between Classical men, or states, or views of the world, there was—for
all the quarrelling and envy and hatred—no inner tension, no deep and
urging need of distance, solitude, ascendancy; and consequently there was none
between the atoms of the Cosmos either. The principle of tension (developed
in the potential theory), which is wholly untranslatable into Classical tongues
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>and incommunicable to Classical minds, has become for Western physics
fundamental. Its content follows from the notion of energy, <em>the Will-to-Power
in Nature</em>, and therefore it is for us just as necessary as for the Classical thought
it is impossible.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>IV</h4>

<p class='c018'><em>Every atomic theory, therefore, is a myth and not an experience.</em> In it the Culture,
through the contemplative-creative power of its great physicists, reveals its inmost
essence and very self. It is only a preconceived idea of criticism that extension
exists in itself and independently of the form-feeling and world-feeling
of the knower. The thinker, in imagining that he can cut out the factor of Life,
forgets that knowing is related to the known as direction is to extension and
that it is only through the living quality of direction that what is felt extends
into distance and depth and becomes space. The cognized structure of the extended
is a projection of the cognizing being.</p>

<p class='c001'>We have already<a id='r481'></a><a href='#f481' class='c019'><sup>[481]</sup></a> shown the decisive importance of the <em>depth-experience</em>,
which is identical with the awakening of a soul and therefore with the creation
of the outer world belonging to that soul. The mere sense-impression contains
only length and breadth, and it is the living and necessary act of interpretation—which,
like everything else living, possesses direction, motion and irreversibility
(the qualities that our consciousness synthesizes in the word Time)—that
<em>adds</em> depth and thereby fashions actuality and world. Life itself enters
into the experiences as third dimension. The double meaning of the word
“far,” which refers both to future and to horizon, betrays the deeper meaning
of this dimension, through which extension as such is evoked. The Becoming
stiffens and passes and is at once the Become; Life stiffens and passes and is at
once the three-dimensional Space of the known. It is common ground for
Descartes and Parmenides that thinking and being, i.e., imagined and extended,
are identical. <span lang="la">“Cogito, ergo sum”</span> is simply the formulation of the depth-experience—I
cognize, and therefore I am in space. But in the style of this
cognizing, and therefore of the cognition-product, the prime-symbol of the
particular Culture comes into play. The perfected extension of the Classical
consciousness is one of sensuous and bodily presence. The Western consciousness
achieves extension, after its own fashion, as transcendental space, and as
it thinks its space more and more transcendentally it develops by degrees the
abstract polarity of Capacity and Intensity that so completely contrasts with
the Classical visual polarity of Matter and Form.</p>

<p class='c001'>But it follows from this that in the known there can be no reappearance of
living time. For this has already passed into the known, into constant “existence,”
as Depth, and hence duration (i.e., timelessness) and extension are identical.
Only the knowing possesses the mark of direction. The application of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>the word “time” to the imaginary and measurable time-dimension of physics
is a mistake. The only question is whether it is possible or not to avoid the
mistake. If one substitutes the word “Destiny” for “time” in any physical
enunciation, one feels at once that pure Nature does not contain Time. The
form-world of physics extends just as far as the cognate form-world of number
and notion extend, and we have seen that (notwithstanding Kant) there is not
and cannot be the slightest relation of any sort between mathematical number
and Time. And yet this is controverted <em>by the fact of motion</em> in the picture of the
world-around. It is the unsolved and unsolvable problem of the Eleatics—being
(or thinking) and motion are incompatible; motion “is” not (is only
“apparent”).</p>

<p class='c001'>And here, for the second time, Natural science becomes dogmatic and mythological.
The words Time and Destiny, for anyone who uses them instinctively,
touch Life itself in its deepest depths—life as a whole, which is not to be
separated from lived-experience. Physics, on the other hand—i.e., the observing
Reason—<em>must</em> separate them. The livingly-experienced “in-itself,”
mentally emancipated from the act of the observer and become object, dead,
inorganic, rigid, is now “Nature,” something open to exhaustive mathematical
treatment. In this sense the knowledge of Nature is an activity of <em>measurement</em>.
All the same, we live even when we are observing and therefore the thing we
are observing <em>lives with us</em>. The element in the Nature-picture in virtue of which
it not merely from moment to moment <em>is</em>, but in a continuous flow with and
around us <em>becomes</em>, is the copula of the waking-consciousness and its world.
This element is <em>called</em> movement, and it contradicts Nature as a picture, but it
represents the <em>history</em> of this picture. And therefore, as precisely as Understanding
is abstracted (by means of words) from feeling and mathematical space from
light-resistances (“things”<a id='r482'></a><a href='#f482' class='c019'><sup>[482]</sup></a>), so also physical “time” is abstracted from the
impression of motion.</p>

<p class='c001'>Physics investigates Nature, and consequently it knows time only as a
length. But the physicist <em>lives</em> in the midst of the <em>history</em> of this Nature, and
therefore he is forced to conceive motion as a mathematically determinable
magnitude, as a concretion of the pure numbers obtained in the experiment and
written down in formulæ. “Physics,” says Kirchhoff, “is the complete and
simple description of motions.” That indeed has always been its object. But
the question is one not of motions <em>in</em> the picture but of motions <em>of</em> the picture.
Motion, in the Nature of physics, is nothing else but that <em>metaphysical</em> something
which gives rise to the consciousness of a succession. The known is timeless
and alien to motion; its state of becomeness implies this. It is the <em>organic
sequence</em> of knowns that gives the impression of a motion. The physicist receives
the word as an impression not upon “reason” but upon the whole man, and the
function of that man is not “Nature” only but the whole world. And that is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>the world-as-history. “Nature,” then, is an expression of the Culture in each
instance.<a id='r483'></a><a href='#f483' class='c019'><sup>[483]</sup></a> All physics is treatment of the motion-problem—in which the
life-problem itself is implicit—not as though it could one day be solved, <em>but
in spite of, nay because of, the fact that it is insoluble</em>. The secret of motion awakens
in man the apprehension of death.<a id='r484'></a><a href='#f484' class='c019'><sup>[484]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>If, then, Nature-knowledge is a subtle kind of self-knowledge—Nature
understood as picture, as mirror of man—the attempt to solve the motion-problem
is an attempt of knowledge to get on the track of its own secret, its
own Destiny.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>V</h4>

<p class='c018'>Only physiognomic tact can, if creative, succeed in this, and in fact it has
done so from time immemorial in the arts, particularly tragic poetry. It is
the thinking man who is perplexed by movement; for the contemplative it
is self-evident. And however completely the former can reduce his perplexities
to system, the result is systematic and not physiognomic, pure extension
logically and numerically ordered, nothing living but something become
and dead.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is this that led Goethe, who was a poet and not a computer, to observe
that “Nature has no system. It has Life, it is Life and succession from an unknown
centre to an unknowable bourne.” For one who does not live it but
knows it, Nature has a system. But it is only a system and nothing more, and
motion is a contradiction in it. The contradiction may be covered up by adroit
formulation, <em>but it lives on in the fundamental concepts</em>. The shock and countershock
of Democritus, the entelechy of Aristotle, the notions of force from the
“impetus” of 14th-Century Occamists to the quantum-theory of radiation,
all contain it. Let the reader conceive of the motion <em>within</em> a physical system as
the <em>ageing</em> of that system (as in fact it is, as lived-experience of the observer),
and he will feel at once and distinctly the fatefulness immanent in, the unconquerably
organic content of, the word “motion” and all its derivative ideas.
But Mechanics, having nothing to do with ageing, should have nothing to do
with motion either, and consequently, since no scientific system is conceivable
without a motion-problem in it, a complete and self-contained mechanics is an
impossibility. Somewhere or other there is always an organic starting-point in
the system where immediate Life enters it—an umbilical cord that connects
the mind-child with the life-mother, the thought with the thinker.</p>

<p class='c001'>This puts the fundamentals of Faustian and Apollinian Nature-science in
quite another light. No “Nature” is pure—there is always something of
history in it. If the man is ahistorical, like the Greek, so that the totality of his
impressions of the world is absorbed in a pure point-formed present, his Nature-image
is static, self-contained (that is, walled against past and future) in every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>individual moment. Time as magnitude figures in Greek physics as little as it
does in Aristotle’s entelechy-idea. If, on the other hand, the Man is historically
constituted, the image formed is dynamic. Number, the definitive evaluation of
the become, is in the case of ahistoric man Measure, and in that of the historical
man Function. One measures only what is present and one follows up only
what has a past and a future, a course. And the effect of this difference is that
the inner inconsistencies of the motion-problem are covered up in Classical
theories and forced into the foreground in Western.</p>

<p class='c001'>History is eternal becoming and therefore eternal future; Nature is become
and therefore eternally past.<a id='r485'></a><a href='#f485' class='c019'><sup>[485]</sup></a> And here a strange inversion seems to have taken
place—the Becoming has lost its priority over the Become. When the intellect
looks back from <em>its</em> sphere, the Become, the aspect of life is reversed, the
idea of Destiny which carries aim and future in it having turned into the
mechanical principle of cause-and-effect of which the centre of gravity lies in
the past. The spatially-experienced is promoted to rank above the temporal
living, and time is replaced by a length in a spatial world-system. And, since
in the creative experience extension follows from direction, the spatial from
life, the human understanding imports life <em>as a process</em> into the inorganic space
of its imagination. While life looks on space as something functionally belonging
to itself, intellect looks upon life as something <em>in</em> space. Destiny asks:
“Whither?”, Causality asks: “Whence?” To establish scientifically means,
starting from the become and actualized, to search for “causes” by going back
along a mechanically-conceived course, that is to say, by treating becoming as
a length. But it is not possible to live backwards, only to think backwards.
Not Time and Destiny are reversible, but only that which the physicist calls
“time” and admits into his formulæ as divisible, and preferably as negative or
imaginary quantities.</p>

<p class='c001'>The perplexity is always there, though it has rarely been seen to be originally
and necessarily inherent. In the Classical science the Eleatics, declining to
admit the necessity of thinking of Nature as in motion, set up against it the
logical view that thinking is a being, with the corollary that known and extended
are identical and knowledge and becoming therefore irreconcilable.
Their criticisms have not been, and cannot be, refuted. But they did not hinder
the evolution of Classical physics, which was a necessary expression of the
Apollinian soul and as such superior to logical difficulties. In the “classical”
mechanics so-called of the Baroque, founded by Galileo and Newton, an irreproachable
solution of the motion-problem on dynamic lines has been sought
again and again. The history of the concept of force, which has been stated
and restated with all the tireless passion of a thought that feels its own self
endangered by a difficulty, is nothing but the history of endeavours to find a
form that is unimpeachable, mathematically and conceptually, for motion. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>last serious attempt—which failed like the rest, and of necessity—was
Hertz’s.</p>

<p class='c001'>Without discovering the true source of all perplexities (no physicist as yet
has done that), Hertz tried to eliminate the notion of force entirely—rightly
feeling that error in all mechanical systems has to be looked for in one or another
of the basic concepts—and to build up the whole picture of physics on the
quantities of time, space and mass. But he did not observe that it is Time itself
(which as direction-factor is present in the force-concept) that is the organic
element without which a dynamic theory cannot be expressed and with which
a clean solution cannot be got. Moreover, quite apart from this, the concepts
force, mass and motion constitute a dogmatic unit. They so condition one
another that the application of one of them tacitly involves both the others
from the outset. The whole Apollinian conception of the motion-problem is
implicit in the root-word ἀρχή, the whole Western conception of it in the force-idea.
The notion of mass is only the complement of that of force. Newton, a
deeply religious nature, was only bringing the Faustian world-feeling to expression
when, to elucidate the words “force” and “motion,” he said that masses
are points of attack for force and carriers for motion. So the 13th-Century
Mystics had conceived of God and his relation to world. Newton no doubt
rejected the metaphysical element in his famous saying “hypotheses non fingo,”
but all the same he was metaphysical through and through in the founding of
his mechanics. <em>Force is the mechanical Nature-picture of western man; what Will is to
his soul-picture and infinite Godhead in his world-picture.</em> The primary ideas of this
physics stood firm long before the first physicist was born, for they lay in the
earliest religious world-consciousness of our Culture.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>VI</h4>

<p class='c018'>With this it becomes manifest that the physical notion of Necessity, too,
has a religious origin. It must not be forgotten that the mechanical necessity
that rules in what our intellects comprehend as Nature is founded upon another
necessity which is organic and fateful in Life itself. The latter creates, the
former restricts. One follows from inward certitude, the other from demonstration;
that is the distinction between tragic and technical, historical and
physical logic.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are, further, differences within the necessity postulated and assumed
by science (that of cause-and-effect) which have so far eluded the keenest sight.
We are confronted here with a question at once of very great difficulty and of
superlative importance. A Nature-knowledge is (however philosophy may
express the relation) a function of knowing, which is in each case knowing in
a particular style. A scientific necessity therefore has the style of <em>the appropriate
intellect</em>, and this brings morphological differences into the field at once.
It is possible to see a strict necessity in Nature even where it may be impossible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>to express it in natural laws. In fact natural laws, which for us are self-evidently
the proper expression-form in science, are not by any means so for the men of
other Cultures. They presuppose a quite special form, the distinctively Faustian
form, of understanding and therefore of Nature-knowing. There is nothing
inherently absurd in the conception of a mechanical necessity wherein each individual
case is morphologically self-contained and never exactly reproduced, in
which therefore the acquisitions of knowledge cannot be put into consistently-valid
formulæ. In such a case Nature would appear (to put it metaphorically)
as an unending decimal that was also non-recurring, destitute of periodicity.
And so, undoubtedly, it was conceived by Classical minds—the feeling of it
manifestly underlies their primary physical concepts. For example, the proper
motion of Democritus’s atoms is such as to exclude any possibility of calculating
motions in advance.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nature-laws are forms of the known in which an aggregate of individual
cases are brought together as a unit of higher degree. Living Time is ignored—that
is, it does not matter whether, when or how often the case arises, for
the question is not of chronological sequence but of mathematical consequence.<a id='r486'></a><a href='#f486' class='c019'><sup>[486]</sup></a>
But in the consciousness that no power in the world can shake this calculation
lies our will to command over Nature. That is Faustian. It is only from this
standpoint that miracles appear as breaches of the laws of Nature. Magian man
saw in them merely the exercise of a power that was not common to all, not in
any way a contradiction of the laws of Nature. And Classical man, according
to Protagoras, was only the measure and not the creator of things—a view
that unconsciously forgoes all conquest of Nature through the discovery and
application of laws.</p>

<p class='c001'>We see, then, that the causality-principle, in the form in which it is self-evidently
necessary for us—the agreed basis of truth for our mathematics,
physics and philosophy—is a Western and, more strictly speaking, a Baroque
phenomenon. It cannot be proved, for every proof set forth in a Western language
and every experiment conducted by a Western mind presupposes itself.
In every problem, the enunciation contains the proof in germ. The method of a
science is the science itself. Beyond question, the notion of laws of Nature and
the conception of physics as <span lang="la">“scientia experimentalis,”</span><a id='r487'></a><a href='#f487' class='c019'><sup>[487]</sup></a> which has held ever
since Roger Bacon, contains <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> this specific kind of necessity. The Classical
mode of regarding Nature—the alter ego of the Classical mode of being—on
the contrary, does <em>not</em> contain it, and yet it does not appear that the scientific
position is weakened in logic thereby. If we work carefully through the utterances
of Democritus, Anaxagoras, and Aristotle (in whom is contained the
whole sum of Classical Nature-speculation), and, above all, if we examine the
connotations of key-terms like ἀλλοίωσις, ἀνάγκη, ἐντελέχεια, we look with
astonishment into a world-image totally unlike our own. This world-image
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>is self-sufficing and therefore, for this definite sort of mankind, unconditionally
true. And causality in our sense plays no part therein.</p>

<p class='c001'>The alchemist or philosopher of the Arabian Culture, too, assumes a necessity
within his world-cavern that is utterly and completely different from the
necessity of dynamics. There is no causal nexus of law-form but only <em>one</em> cause,
God, immediately underlying <em>every</em> effect. To believe in Nature-laws would,
from this standpoint, be to doubt the almightiness of God. If a rule seems to
emerge, it is because it pleases God so; but to suppose that this rule was a
necessity would be to yield to a temptation of the Devil. This was the attitude
also of Carneades, Plotinus and the Neo-Pythagoreans.<a id='r488'></a><a href='#f488' class='c019'><sup>[488]</sup></a> <em>This</em> necessity underlies
the Gospels as it does the Talmud and the Avesta, and upon it rests the
technique of alchemy.</p>

<p class='c001'>The conception of number as function is related to the dynamic principle of
cause-and-effect. Both are creations of the same intellect, expression-forms of
the same spirituality, formative principles of the same objectivized and “become”
Nature. In fact the physics of Democritus differs from the physics of
Newton in that the chosen starting-point of the one is the optically-given
while that of the other is abstract relations that have been deduced from
it. The “facts” of Apollinian Nature-knowledge are things, and they lie
on the surface of the known, but the facts of Faustian science are relations,
which in general are invisible to lay eyes, which have to be mastered intellectually,
which require for their communication a code-language that only
the expert researcher can fully understand. The Classical, static, necessity is
immediately evident in the changing phenomena, while the dynamic causation-principle
prevails beyond things and its tendency is to weaken, or to
abolish even, their sensible actuality. Consider, for example, the world of
significance that is connected, under present-day hypotheses, with the expression
“a magnet.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The principle of the Conservation of Energy, which since its enunciation
by J. R. Mayer has been regarded in all seriousness as a plain conceptual necessity,
is in fact a redescription of the <em>dynamic</em> principle of causality by means
of the physical concept of force. The appeal to “experience,” and the controversy
as to whether judgment is necessary or empirical—i.e., in the language
of Kant (who greatly deceived himself about the highly-fluid boundaries
between the two), whether it is <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> or <span lang="la"><i>a posteriori</i></span> certain—are characteristically
Western. Nothing seems to us more self-evident and unambiguous
than “experience” as the source of exact science. The Faustian experiment,
based on working hypotheses and employing the methods of measurement, is
nothing but the systematic and exhaustive exploitation of this “experience.”
But no one has noticed that a whole world-view is implicit in such a concept of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>“experience” with its aggressive dynamic connotation, and that there is not
and cannot be “experience” in this pregnant sense for men of other Cultures.
When we decline to recognize the scientific results of Anaxagoras or Democritus
as experiential results, it does not mean that these Classical thinkers were incapable
of interpreting and merely threw off fancies, but that we miss in their
generalizations that causal element which for us <em>constitutes</em> experience in our
sense of the word. Manifestly, we have never yet given adequate thought to the
<em>singularity</em> of this, the pure Faustian, conception of experience. The contrast
between it and faith is obvious—and entirely superficial. For indeed exact
sensuous-intellectual experience is in point of structure completely congruent
with that heart-experience (as we may well call it), that illumination which
deep religious natures of the West (Pascal, for instance, whom one and the same
necessity made mathematician and Jansenist) have known in the significant
moments of their being. Experience means to us an <em>activity</em> of the intellect,
which does not resignedly confine itself to receiving, acknowledging and
arranging momentary and purely present impressions, but seeks them out and
calls them up in order to overcome them in their sensuous presence and to bring
them into an unbounded unity in which their sensuous discreteness is dissolved.
Experience in our sense possesses the tendency <em>from particular to infinite</em>. And for
that very reason it is in contradiction with the feeling of Classical science.
What for us is the way to acquire experience is for the Greek the way to lose it.
And therefore he kept away from the drastic method of experiment; therefore
his physics, instead of being a mighty system of worked-out laws and formulæ
that strong-handedly override the sense-present (“only knowledge is power”),
is an aggregate of impressions—well ordered, intensified by sensuous imagery,
clean-edged—which leaves Nature intact in its self-completeness. Our exact
Natural science is imperative, the Classical is θεωρία in the literal sense, the
result of passive contemplativeness.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>VII</h4>

<p class='c018'>We can now say without any hesitation that the form-world of a Natural
science corresponds to those of the appropriate mathematic, the appropriate
religion, the appropriate art. A deep mathematician—by which is meant
not a master-computer but a man, any man, who feels the spirit of numbers
living within him—realizes that through it he “knows God.” Pythagoras
and Plato knew this as well as Pascal and Leibniz did so. Terentius Varro, in
his examination of the old Roman religion (dedicated to Julius Cæsar), distinguished
with Roman seriousness between the <span lang="la"><i>theologia civilis</i></span>, the sum of
officially-recognized belief, the <span lang="la"><i>theologia mythica</i></span>, the imagination-world of poets
and artists, and the <span lang="la"><i>theologia physica</i></span> of philosophical speculation. Applying
this to the Faustian Culture, that which Thomas Aquinas and Luther, Calvin
and Loyola taught belongs to the first category, Dante and Goethe belong to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>the second; and to the third belongs scientific physics, inasmuch as behind its
formulæ there are images.</p>

<p class='c001'>Not only primitive man and the child, but also the higher animals spontaneously
evolve from the small everyday experiences an image of Nature which
contains the sum of technical indications observed as recurrent. The eagle
“knows” the moment at which to swoop down on the prey; the singing-bird
sitting on the eggs “knows” the approach of the marten; the deer “finds” the
place where there is food. In man, this experience of all the senses has narrowed
and deepened itself into experience of the eye. But, as the habit of verbal speech
has now been superadded, understanding comes to be abstracted from seeing,
and thenceforward develops independently as reasoning; to the instantly-comprehending
<em>technique</em> is added the reflective <em>theory</em>. Technique applies itself
to visible near things and plain needs, theory to the distance and the terrors of
the invisible. By the side of the petty knowledge of everyday life it sets up
belief. And still they evolve, there is a new knowledge and a new and higher
technique, and to the myth there is added the cult. The one teaches how to
know the “numina,” the other how to conquer them. For theory in the eminent
sense is religious through and through. It is only in quite late states that
scientific theory evolves out of religious, <em>through men having become aware of
methods</em>. Apart from this there is little alteration. The image-world of physics
remains mythic, its procedure remains a cult of conjuring the powers in things,
and the images that it forms and the methods that it uses remain generically
dependent upon those of the appropriate religion.<a id='r489'></a><a href='#f489' class='c019'><sup>[489]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>From the later days of the Renaissance onward, the notion of God has
steadily approximated, in the spirit of every man of high significance, to the
idea of pure endless Space. The God of Ignatius Loyola’s <span lang="la"><i>exercitia spiritualis</i></span> is
the God also of Luther’s <span lang="de">“ein’ feste Burg,”</span> of the Improperia of Palestrina and
the Cantatas of Bach. He is no longer the Father of St. Francis of Assisi and
the high-vaulted cathedrals, the personally-present, caring and mild God felt
by Gothic painters like Giotto and Stephen Lochner, but an impersonal principle;
unimaginable, intangible, working mysteriously in the Infinite. Every
relic of personality dissolves into insensible abstraction, such a divinity as only
instrumental music of the grand style is capable of representing, a divinity before
which painting breaks down and drops into the background. This God-feeling
it was that formed the scientific world-image of the West, its “Nature,”
its “experience” and therefore its theories and its methods, in direct contradiction
to those of the Classical. The force which moves the mass—that is what
Michelangelo painted in the Sistine Chapel; that is what we feel growing more
and more intense from the archetype of Il Gesù to the climax in the cathedral
façades of Della Porta and Maderna, and from Heinrich Schütz to the transcendent
tone-worlds of 18th-Century church music; that is what in Shakespearian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>tragedy fills with world-becoming scenes widened to infinity. And that is
what Galileo and Newton captured in formulæ and concepts.</p>

<p class='c001'>The word “God” rings otherwise under the vaulting of Gothic cathedrals
or in the cloisters of Maulbronn and St. Gallen than in the basilicas of Syria and
the temples of Republican Rome. The character of the Faustian cathedral is
that of the <em>forest</em>. The mighty elevation of the nave above the flanking aisles,
in contrast to the flat roof of the basilica; the transformation of the columns,
which with base and capital had been set as self-contained individuals in space,
into pillars and clustered-pillars that grow up out of the earth and spread on
high into an infinite subdivision and interlacing of lines and branches; the giant
windows by which the wall is dissolved and the interior filled with mysterious
light—these are the architectural actualizing of a world-feeling that had
found the first of all its symbols in the high forest of the Northern plains, the
deciduous forest with its mysterious tracery, its whispering of ever-mobile
foliage over men’s heads, its branches straining through the trunks to be free
of earth. Think of Romanesque ornamentation and its deep affinity to the sense
of the woods. The endless, lonely, twilight wood became and remained the
secret wistfulness in all Western building-forms, so that when the form-energy
of the style died down—in late Gothic as in closing Baroque—the controlled
abstract line-language resolved itself immediately into naturalistic branches,
shoots, twigs and leaves.</p>

<p class='c001'>Cypresses and pines, with their corporeal and Euclidean effect, could never
have become symbols of unending space. But the oaks, beeches and lindens
with the fitful light-flecks playing in their shadow-filled volume are felt as
bodiless, boundless, spiritual. The stem of the cypress finds conclusive fulfilment
of its vertical tendency in the defined columniation of its cone-masses, but
that of an oak seems, ever restless and unsatisfied, to strain beyond its summit.
In the ash, the victory of the upstriving branches over the unity of the crown
seems actually to be won. Its aspect is of something dissolving, something
expanding into space, and it was for this probably that the World-Ash Yggdrasil
became a symbol in the Northern mythology. The rustle of the woods,
a charm that no Classical poet ever felt—for it lies beyond the possibilities of
Apollinian Nature-feeling—stands with its secret questions “whence?
whither?” its merging of presence into eternity, in a deep relation with Destiny,
with the feeling of History and Duration, with the quality of Direction that
impels the anxious, caring, Faustian soul towards infinitely-distant Future.
And for that reason the organ, that roars deep and high through our churches in
tones which, compared with the plain solid notes of aulos and cithara, seem to
know neither limit nor restraint, is the instrument of instruments in Western
devotions. Cathedral and organ form a symbolic unity like temple and statue.
The history of organ-building, one of the most profound and moving chapters
of our musical history, is a history of a longing for the forest, a longing to speak
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>in the language of that true temple of Western God-fearing. From the verse of
Wolfram von Eschenbach to the music of “Tristan” this longing has borne
fruit unceasingly. Orchestra-tone strove tirelessly in the 18th Century towards
a nearer kinship with the organ-tone. The word <span lang="de">“schwebend”</span>—meaningless
as applied to Classical things—is important alike in the theory of music, in
oil-painting, in architecture and in the dynamic physics of the Baroque. Stand
in a high wood of mighty stems while the storm is tearing above, and you will
comprehend instantly the full meaning of the concept of a force which moves
mass.</p>

<p class='c001'>Out of such a primary feeling in the existence that has become thoughtful
there arises, then, an idea of the Divine immanent in the world-around, and
this idea becomes steadily more definite. The thoughtful percipient takes in
the impression of motion in outer Nature. He feels about him an almost indescribable
<em>alien life</em> of unknown powers, and traces the origin of these effects to
“numina,” to The Other, inasmuch as this Other also possesses Life. Astonishment
at <em>alien motion</em> is the source of religion and of physics both; respectively,
they are the elucidations of Nature (world-around) by the soul and by
the reason. The “powers” are the first object both of fearful or loving reverence
and of critical investigation. There is a religious experience <em>and</em> a scientific
experience.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now it is important to observe how the consciousness of the Culture intellectually
concretes its primary “numina.” It imposes significant words—<em>names</em>—on
them and there conjures (seizes or bounds) them. By virtue of
the Name they are subject to the intellectual power of the man who possesses
the Name, and (as has been shown already) the whole of philosophy, the
whole of science, and everything that is related in any way to “knowing”
is at the very bottom nothing but an infinitely-refined mode of <i>applying the
name-magic of the primitive to the “alien.”</i> The pronouncement of the right
name (in physics, the right concept) is an incantation. Deities and basic
notions of science alike come into being first as vocable names, with which
is linked an idea that tends to become more and more sensuously definite.
The outcome of a <span lang="la"><i>Numen</i></span> is a <span lang="la"><i>Deus</i></span>, the outcome of a notion is an idea. In
the mere naming of “thing-in-itself,” “atom,” “energy,” “gravitation,”
“cause,” “evolution” and the like is for most learned men the same sense
of deliverance as there was for the peasant of Latium in the words “Ceres,”
“Consus,” “Janus,” “Vesta.”<a id='r490'></a><a href='#f490' class='c019'><sup>[490]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>For the Classical world-feeling, conformably to the Apollinian depth-experience
and its symbolism, the individual body was “Being.” Logically
therefore the form of this body, as it presented itself in the light, was felt as its
essence, as the true purport of the word “being.” What has not shape, what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>is not a shape, is not at all. On the basis of this feeling (which was of an intensity
that we can hardly imagine) the Classical spirit created as counter-concept<a id='r491'></a><a href='#f491' class='c019'><sup>[491]</sup></a>
to the form of “The Other” <em>Non-Form</em> viz., stuff, ἀρχή, ὕλη, that
which in itself possesses no being and is merely complement to the actual
“Ent,” representing a secondary and corollary necessity. In these conditions, it
is easy to see how the Classical pantheon inevitably shaped itself, as a higher
mankind side by side with the common mankind, as a set of perfectly-formed
bodies, of high possibilities incarnate and present, but in the unessential of
stuff not distinguished and therefore subject to the same cosmic and tragic
necessity.</p>

<p class='c001'>It is otherwise that the Faustian world-feeling experiences depth. Here the
sum of true Being appears as pure efficient Space, which <em>is</em> being. And therefore
what is sensuously felt, what is very significantly designated the plenum (das
Raumerfüllende), is felt as a fact of the second order, as something questionable
or specious, as a resistance that must be overcome by philosopher or physicist
before the true content of Being can be discovered. Western scepticism has never
been directed against Space, always against tangible things only. Space is the
<em>higher</em> idea—force is only a less abstract expression for it—and it is only as a
counter-concept to space that mass arises. For mass is what is <em>in</em> space and is
logically and physically dependent upon space. From the assumption of a wave-motion
of light, which underlies the conception of light as a form of energy,
the assumption of a corresponding mass, the “luminiferous æther” necessarily
followed. A definition of mass and ascription of properties to mass follows
from the definition of force (and not vice versa) with all the necessity of a
symbol. All Classical notions of substantiality, however they differed amongst
themselves as realist or idealist, distinguish a “to-be-formed,” that is, a
Nonent, which only receives closer definition from the basic concept of form,
whatever this form may be in the particular philosophical system. All Western
notions of substantiality distinguish a “to-be-moved,” which also is a negative,
no doubt, but one polar to a different positive. <em>Form and non-form, force and
non-force</em>—these words render as clearly as may be the polarities that in the two
Cultures underlie the world-impression and contain all its modes. That which
comparative philosophy has hitherto rendered inaccurately and misleadingly
by the one word “matter” signifies in the one case the substratum of shape, in
the other the substratum of force. No two notions could differ more completely.
For here it is the feeling of God, a <em>sense of values</em>, that is speaking. The Classical
deity is superlative shape, the Faustian superlative force. The “Other” is the
Ungodly to which the spirit will not accord the dignity of Being; to the Apollinian
world-feeling this ungodly “other” is substance without shape, to the
Faustian it is substance without force.</p>

<p class='c018'>Scientists are wont to assume that myths and God-ideas are creations of
primitive man, and that as spiritual culture “advances,” this myth-forming
power is shed. In reality it is the exact opposite, and had not the morphology
of history remained to this day an almost unexplored field, the supposedly universal
mythopoetic power would long ago have been found to be limited to
particular periods. It would have been realized that this ability of a soul to
fill its world with shapes, traits and symbols—like and consistent amongst
themselves—belongs most decidedly not to the world-age of the primitives
but exclusively to the springtimes of <em>great</em> Cultures.<a id='r492'></a><a href='#f492' class='c019'><sup>[492]</sup></a> Every myth of the great
style stands at the beginning of an awakening spirituality. It is the first formative
act of that spirituality. Nowhere else is it to be found. There—it <em>must</em>
be.</p>

<p class='c001'>I make the assumption that that which a primitive folk—like the Egyptians
of Thinite times, the Jews and Persians before Cyrus,<a id='r493'></a><a href='#f493' class='c019'><sup>[493]</sup></a> the heroes of the
Mycenæan burghs and the Germans of the Migrations—possesses in the way
of religious ideas is not yet myth in the higher sense. It may well be a sum of
scattered and irregular traits, of cults adhering to names, fragmentary saga-pictures,
but it is not yet a divine order, a mythic organism, and I no more
regard this as myth than I regard the ornament of that stage as art. And, be it
said, the greatest caution is necessary in dealing with the symbols and sagas
current to-day, or even those current centuries ago, amongst ostensibly primitive
peoples, for in those thousands of years every country in the world has been
more or less affected by some high Culture alien to it.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are, therefore, as many form-worlds of great myth as there are Cultures
and early architectures. The antecedents—that chaos of undeveloped
imagery in which modern folk-lore research, for want of a guiding principle,
loses itself—do not, on this hypothesis, concern us; but we <em>are</em> concerned, on
the other hand, with certain cultural manifestations that have never yet been
thought of as belonging to this category. It was in the Homeric age (1100-800
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span>) and in the corresponding knightly age of Teutonism (900-1200 <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>),
that is, the <em>epic</em> ages, and neither before nor after them, that the great world-image
of a new religion came into being. The corresponding ages in India and
Egypt are the Vedic and the Pyramid periods; one day it will be discovered that
Egyptian mythology did in fact ripen into <em>depth</em> during the Third and Fourth
Dynasties.</p>

<p class='c001'>Only in this way can we understand the immense wealth of religious-intuitive
creations that fills the three centuries of the Imperial Age in Germany.
What came into existence then was <em>the Faustian mythology</em>. Hitherto, owing
to religious and learned preconceptions, either the Catholic element has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>treated to the exclusion of the Northern-Heathen or vice versa, and consequently
we have been blind to the breadth and the unity of this form-world. In reality
there is no such difference. The deep change of meaning in the Christian circle
of ideas is identical, as a creative act, with the consolidation of the old heathen
cults of the Migrations. It was in this age that the folk-lore of Western Europe
became an entirety; if the bulk of its material was far older, and if, far later
again, it came to be linked with new outer experiences and enriched by more
conscious treatment, yet it was then and neither earlier nor later that it was
vitalized with its symbolic meaning. To this lore belong the great God-legends
of the Edda and many motives in the gospel-poetry of learned monks;
the German hero-tales of Siegfried and Gudrun, Dietrich and Wayland; the
vast wealth of chivalry-tales, derived from ancient Celtic fables, that was
simultaneously coming to harvest on French soil, concerning King Arthur and
the Round Table, the Holy Grail, Tristan, Percival and Roland. And with these
are to be counted—beside the spiritual transvaluation, unremarked but all the
deeper for that, of the Passion-Story—the Catholic hagiology of which the
richest floraison was in the 10th and 11th Centuries and which produced the
Lives of the Virgin and the histories of SS. Roch, Sebald, Severin, Francis,
Bernard, Odilia. The <span lang="la"><i>Legenda Aurea</i></span> was composed about 1250—this was the
blossoming-time of courtly epic and Icelandic skald-poetry alike. The great
Valhalla Gods of the North and the mythic group of the “Fourteen Helpers”
in South Germany are contemporary, and by the side of Ragnarök, the Twilight
of the Gods, in the Völuspa we have a Christian form in the South German
Muspilli. This great myth develops, like heroic poetry, at the <em>climax</em> of the
early Culture. They both belong to the two primary estates, priesthood and
nobility; they are at home in the cathedral and the castle and not in the village
below, where amongst the people the simple saga-world lives on for centuries,
called “fairy-tale,” “popular beliefs” or “superstition” and yet inseparable
from the world of high centemplation.<a id='r494'></a><a href='#f494' class='c019'><sup>[494]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>Nowhere is the final meaning of these religious creations more clearly indicated
than in the history of Valhalla. It was not an original German idea,
and even the tribes of the Migrations were totally without it. It took shape
just at <em>this</em> time, instantly and as an inward necessity, in the consciousness of
the peoples newly-arisen on the soil of the West. Thus it is “contemporary”
with Olympus, which we know from the Homeric epos and which is as little
Mycenæan as Valhalla is German in origin. <a id='corr400.36'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Moveover'>Moreover</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_400.36'>Moreover</a></span>, it is only for the two
higher estates that Valhalla emerges from the notion of Hel; in the beliefs of
the people Hel remained the realm of the dead.<a id='r495'></a><a href='#f495' class='c019'><sup>[495]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>The deep inward unity of this Faustian world of myth and saga and the
complete congruence of its expression-symbolism has never hitherto been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>realized, and yet Siegfried, Baldur, Roland, Christ the King in the “Heliand,”
are different names for one and the same figure. Valhalla and Avalon,
the Round Table and the communion of the Grail-templars, Mary, Frigga and
Frau Holle mean the same. On the other hand, the external provenance of the
material motives and elements, on which mythological research has wasted an
excessive zeal, is a matter of which the importance does not go deeper than the
surface. As to the meaning of a myth, its provenance proves <em>nothing</em>. The
“numen” itself, the primary form of the world-feeling, is a pure, necessary and
unconscious creation, and it is not transferable. What one people takes over
from another—in “conversion” or in admiring imitation—is a name, dress
and mask for its own feeling, never the feeling of that other. The old Celtic
and old Germanic myth-motives have to be treated, like the repertory of
Classical forms possessed by the learned monk, and like the entire body of
Christian-Eastern faith taken over by the Western Church, simply as the
material out of which the Faustian soul in these centuries created a mythic
architecture of its own. It mattered little whether the persons through whose
minds and mouths the myth came to life were individual skalds, missionaries,
priests or “the people,” nor did the circumstance that the Christian
ideas dictated its forms affect the inward independence of that which had
come to life.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the Classical, Arabian and Western Cultures, the myth of the springtime
is in each case that which we should expect; in the first static, in the second
Magian, in the third dynamic. Examine every detail of form, and see how in
the Classical it is an attitude and in the West a deed, there a being and here a
will that underlies them; how in the Classical the bodily and tangible, the
sensuously-saturated, prevails and how therefore in the mode of worshipping
the centre of gravity lies in the sense-impressive <em>cult</em>, whereas in the North it is
space, force and therefore a religiousness that is predominantly dogmatic in
colouring that rule. These very earliest creations of the young soul tell us that
there is relationship between the Olympian figures, the statue and the corporeal
Doric temple; between the domical basilica, the “Spirit” of God and
the arabesque; between Valhalla and the Mary myth, the soaring nave and
instrumental music.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Arabian soul built up its myth in the centuries between Cæsar and Constantine—that
fantastic mass of cults, visions and legends that to-day we can
hardly even survey,<a id='r496'></a><a href='#f496' class='c019'><sup>[496]</sup></a> syncretic cults like that of the Syrian Baal and of Isis and
Mithras not only transported to but transformed in Syrian soil; Gospels, Acts
of Apostles and Apocalypses in astonishing profusion; Christian, Persian, Jewish,
Neoplatonist and Manichæan legends, and the heavenly hierarchy of angels
and spirits of the Fathers and the Gnostics. In the suffering-story of the
Gospels, <em>the very epic of the Christian nation</em>, set between the story of Jesus’s childhood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>and the Acts of the Apostles, and in the Zoroaster-legend that is contemporary
with it, we are looking upon the hero-figures of Early Arabian epic
as we see Achilles in the Classical and Siegfried and Percival in the Faustian. The
scenes of Gethsemane and Golgotha stand beside the noblest pictures of Greek
and Germanic saga. These Magian visions, almost without exception, grew up
under the pressure of the dying Classical which, in the nature of things unable
to communicate its spirit, the more insistently lent its forms. It is almost impossible
now to estimate the extent to which given Apollinian elements had to
be accepted and transvalued before the old Christian myth assumed the firmness
that it possessed in the time of Augustine.</p>

<h4 class='c026'>IX</h4>

<p class='c018'>The Classical polytheism, consequently, has a style of its own which puts
it in a different category from the conceptions of any other world-feelings,
whatever the superficial affinities may be. This mode of possessing gods without
godhead has only existed once, and it was in the one Culture that made the
statue of naked Man the whole sum of its art.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nature, as Classical man felt and knew it about him, viz., a sum of well-formed
bodily things, could not be deified in any other form but this. The
Roman felt that the claim of Yahweh to be recognized as sole God had something
atheistic in it. One God, for him, was no God, and to this may be ascribed
the strong dislike of popular feeling, both Greek and Roman, for the
philosophers in so far as they were pantheists and godless. Gods are bodies,
σώματα of the perfectest kind, and plurality was an attribute of bodies alike for
mathematicians, lawyers and poets. The concept of ζῷον πολιτικόν was valid
for gods as well as for men; nothing was more alien to them than oneness,
solitariness and self-adequacy; and no existence therefore was possible to them
save under the aspect of eternal propinquity. It is a deeply significant fact that
in Hellas of all countries star-gods, the numina of the Far, are wanting. Helios
was worshipped only in half-Oriental Rhodes and Selene had no cult at all.
Both are merely artistic modes of expression (it is as such only that they figure
in the courtly epos of Homer), elements that Varro would class in the <span lang="la"><i>genus mythicum</i></span>
and not in the <span lang="la"><i>genus civile</i></span>. The old Roman religion, in which the Classical
world-feeling was expressed with special purity, knew neither sun nor moon,
neither storm nor cloud as deities. The forest stirrings and the forest solitude,
the tempest and the surf, which completely dominated the Nature of Faustian
man (even that of pre-Faustian Celts and Teutons) and imparted to their
mythology its peculiar character, left Classical man unmoved. Only concretes—hearth
and door, the coppice and the plot-field, this particular river and that
particular hill—condensed into Being for him. We observe that everything
that has farness, everything that contains a suggestion of unbounded and unbodied
in it and might thereby bring space as Ent and divine into the felt Nature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>is excluded and remains excluded from Classical myth; how should it surprise,
then, if clouds and horizons, that are the very meaning and soul of Baroque
landscapes, are totally wanting in the Classical backgroundless frescoes? The
unlimited multitude of antique gods—every tree, every spring, every house,
nay every part of a house is a god—means that every tangible thing is an
<em>independent</em> existence, and therefore that none is functionally subordinate to any
other.</p>

<p class='c001'>The bases of the Apollinian and the Faustian Nature-images respectively are
in all contexts the two opposite symbols of <em>individual thing</em> and <em>unitary space</em>.
Olympus and Hades are perfectly sense-definite places, while the kingdom of the
dwarfs, elves and goblins, and Valhalla and Niflheim are all somewhere or
other in the universe of space. In the old Roman religion <span lang="la">“Tellus Mater”</span> is
not the all-mother but the visible ploughable field itself. Faunus <em>is</em> the wood
and Vulturnus <em>is</em> the river, the name of the seed <em>is</em> Ceres and that of the harvest
<em>is</em> Consus. Horace is a true Roman when he speaks of <span lang="la">“sub Jove frigido,”</span> under
the cold sky. In these cases there is not even the attempt to reproduce the God
in any sort of image at the places of worship, for that would be tantamount to
duplicating him. Even in very late times the instinct not only of the Romans
but of the Greeks also is opposed to idols, as is shown by the fact that plastic
art, as it became more and more profane, came into conflict more and more with
popular beliefs and the devout philosophy.<a id='r497'></a><a href='#f497' class='c019'><sup>[497]</sup></a> In the house, Janus is the door as
god, Vesta the hearth as goddess, the two functions of the house are objectivized
and deified at once. A Hellenic river-god (like Acheloüs, who appears as a bull,)
is definitely understood as being the river and not as, so to say, dwelling in the
river. The Pans<a id='r498'></a><a href='#f498' class='c019'><sup>[498]</sup></a> and Satyrs are the fields and meadows as noon defines them,
well bounded and, as having figure, having also existence. Dryads and Hamadrayads
<em>are</em> trees; in many places, indeed, individual trees of great stature were
honoured with garlands and votive offerings without even the formality of a
name. On the contrary, not a trace of this localized materiality clings to the
elves, dwarfs, witches, Valkyries and their kindred the armies of departed souls
that sweep round o’nights. Whereas Naiads <em>are</em> sources, nixies and hags, and
tree-spirits and brownies are souls that are only bound to sources, trees and
houses, from which they long to be released into the freedom of roaming. This
is the very opposite of the plastic Nature-feeling, for here things are experienced
merely as spaces of another kind. A nymph—a spring, that is—assumes
human form when she would visit a handsome shepherd, but a nixy is an enchanted
princess with nenuphars in her hair who comes up at midnight from
the depths of the pool wherein she dwells. Kaiser Barbarossa sits in the Kyffhäuser
cavern and Frau Venus in the Hörselberg. It is as though the Faustian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>universe abhorred anything material and impenetrable. In things, we suspect
other worlds. Their hardness and thickness is merely appearance, and—a trait
that would be impossible in Classical myth, because fatal to it—some favoured
mortals are accorded the power to see through cliffs and crags into the depths.
But is not just this the secret intent of our physical theories, of each new
hypothesis? No other Culture knows so many fables of treasures lying in mountains
and pools, of secret subterranean realms, palaces, gardens wherein other
beings dwell. The whole substantiality of the visible world is denied by the
Faustian Nature-feeling, for which in the end nothing is of earth and the only
actual is Space. The fairy-tale dissolves the matter of Nature as the Gothic
style dissolves the stone-mass of our cathedrals, into a ghostly wealth of forms
and lines that have shed all weight and acknowledge no bounds.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ever-increasing emphasis with which Classical polytheism somatically
individualized its deities is peculiarly evident in its attitude to “strange gods.”
For Classical man the gods of the Egyptians, the Phœnicians and the Germans,
in so far as they could be imagined as figures, were as real as his own gods.
Within his world-feeling the statement that such other gods “do not exist”
would have no meaning. When he came into contact with the countries of
these deities he did them reverence. The gods were, like a statue or a polis,
Euclidean bodies having locality. They were beings of the near and not the
general space. If a man were sojourning in Babylon, for instance, and Zeus and
Apollo were far away, all the more reason for <em>particularly</em> honouring the local
gods. This is the meaning of the altars dedicated “to the unknown gods,”
such as that which Paul so significantly misunderstood in a Magian monotheistic
sense at Athens.<a id='r499'></a><a href='#f499' class='c019'><sup>[499]</sup></a> These were gods not known by name to the Greek but
worshipped by the foreigners of the great seaports (Piræus, Corinth or other) and
therefore entitled to their due of respect from him. Rome expressed this with
Classical clearness in her religious law and in carefully-preserved formulæ like,
for example, the <span lang="la"><i>generalis invocatio</i></span>.<a id='r500'></a><a href='#f500' class='c019'><sup>[500]</sup></a> As the universe is the sum of things, and
as gods are things, recognition had to be accorded even to those gods with
whom the Roman had not yet practically and historically come into relations.
He did not know them, or he knew them as the gods of his enemies, but they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span><em>were</em> gods, for it was impossible for him to conceive the opposite. This is the
meaning of the sacral phrase in Livy, VIII, 9, 6: <span lang="la">“di quibus est potestas nostrorum
hostiumque.”</span> The Roman people admits that the circle of its own gods
is only momentarily bounded, and after reciting these by name it ends the prayer
thus so as not to infringe the rights of others. According to its sacral law, the
annexation of foreign territory involves the transfer to Urbs Roma of all the
religious obligations pertaining to this territory and its gods—which of course
logically follows from the <em>additive</em> god-feeling of the Classical. Recognition of
a deity was very far from being the same as acceptance of the forms of its cult;
thus in the Second Punic War the Great Mother of Pessinus<a id='r501'></a><a href='#f501' class='c019'><sup>[501]</sup></a> was received in
Rome as the Sibyl commanded, but the priests who had come in with her cult,
which was of a highly un-Classical complexion, practised under strict police supervision,
and not only Roman citizens but even their slaves were forbidden
under penalty to enter this priesthood. The reception of the goddess gave satisfaction
to the Classical world-feeling, but the personal performance of her
despised ritual would have infringed it. The attitude of the Senate in such cases
is unmistakable, though the people, with its ever-increasing admixture of
Eastern elements, had a liking for these cults and in Imperial times the army
became in virtue of its composition a vehicle (and even the chief vehicle) of the
Magian world-feeling.</p>

<p class='c001'>This makes it the easier to understand how the cult of deified men could become
a <em>necessary</em> element in this religious form-world. But here it is necessary
to distinguish sharply between Classical phenomena and Oriental phenomena
that have a superficial similarity thereto. Roman emperor-worship—i.e.,
the reverence of the “genius” of the living Princes and that of the dead predecessors
as “Divi”—has hitherto been confused with the ceremonial reverence
of the Ruler which was customary in Asia Minor (and, above all, in Persia,)<a id='r502'></a><a href='#f502' class='c019'><sup>[502]</sup></a>
and also with the later and quite differently meant Caliph-deification which is
seen in full process of formation in Diocletian and Constantine. Actually, these
are all very unlike things. However intimately these symbolic forms were
interfused in the East of the Empire, in Rome itself the Classical type was
actualized unequivocally and without adulteration. Long before this certain
Greeks (e.g., Sophocles, Lysander and, above all, Alexander) had been not merely
hailed as gods by their flatterers but felt as gods in a perfectly definite sense
by the people. It is only a step, after all, from the deification of a thing—such
as a copse or a well or, in the limit, a statue which represented a god—to the
deification of an outstanding man who became first hero and then god. In this
case as in the rest, what was reverenced was the perfect shape in which the
world-stuff, the un-divine, had actualized itself. In Rome the consul on the day
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>of his triumph wore the armour of Jupiter Capitolinus, and in early days his
face and arms were even painted red, in order to enhance his similarity to the
terra-cotta statue of the God whose “numen” he for the time being incorporated.</p>

<h4 class='c026'>X</h4>

<p class='c018'>In the first generations of the Imperial age, the antique polytheism gradually
dissolved, often without any alteration of outward ritual and mythic form, into
the Magian monotheism.<a id='r503'></a><a href='#f503' class='c019'><sup>[503]</sup></a> A new soul had come up, and it lived the old forms
in a new mode. The names continued, but they covered other numina.</p>

<p class='c001'>In all Late-Classical cults, those of Isis and Cybele, of Mithras and Sol and
Serapis, the divinity is no longer felt as a localized and formable being. In old
times, Hermes Propylæus had been worshipped at the entrance of the Acropolis
of Athens, while a few yards away, at the point where later the Erechtheum
was built, was the cult-site of Hermes as the husband of Aglaure. At the South
extremity of the Roman Capitol, close to the sanctuary of Juppiter Feretrius
(which contained, not a statue of the god, but a holy stone, <em>silex</em><a id='r504'></a><a href='#f504' class='c019'><sup>[504]</sup></a>) was that of
Juppiter Optimus Maximus, and when Augustus was laying down the huge
temple of the latter he was careful to avoid the ground to which the numen of
the former adhered.<a id='r505'></a><a href='#f505' class='c019'><sup>[505]</sup></a> But in Early Christian times Juppiter Dolichenus or Sol
Invictus<a id='r506'></a><a href='#f506' class='c019'><sup>[506]</sup></a> could be worshipped “wheresoever two or three were gathered together
in his name.” All these deities more and more came to be felt as a single
numen, though the adherents of a particular cult would believe that they in
particular knew the numen in its true shape. Hence it is that Isis could be
spoken of as the “million-named.” Hitherto, names had been the designations
of so many gods different in body and locality, now they are <em>titles</em> of the One
whom every man has in mind.</p>

<p class='c001'>This Magian monotheism reveals itself in all the religious creations that
flooded the Empire from the East—the Alexandrian Isis, the Sun-god favoured
by Aurelian (the Baal of Palmyra), the Mithras protected by Diocletian (whose
Persian form had been completely recast in Syria), the Baalath of Carthage
(Tanit, Dea Cælestis<a id='r507'></a><a href='#f507' class='c019'><sup>[507]</sup></a>) honoured by Septimius Severus. The importation of
these figures no longer increases as in Classical times the number of concrete
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>gods. On the contrary, they absorb the old gods into themselves, and do so in
such a way as to deprive them more and more of picturable shape. Alchemy is
replacing statics. Correspondingly, instead of the image we more and more
find symbols—e.g., the Bull, the Lamb, the Fish, the Triangle, the Cross—coming
to the front. In Constantine’s <span lang="la">“in hoc signo vinces”</span> scarcely an
echo of the Classical remains. Already there is setting in that aversion to
human representation that ended in the Islamic and Byzantine prohibitions
of images.</p>

<p class='c001'>Right down to Trajan—long after the last trait of Apollinian world-feeling
had departed from the soil of Greece—the Roman state-worship had strength
enough to hold to the Euclidean tendency and to <em>augment</em> its world of deities.
The gods of the subject lands and peoples were accorded recognized places of
worship, with priesthood and ritual, in Rome, and were themselves associated
as perfectly definite individuals with the older gods. But from that point the
Magian spirit began to gain ground even here, in spite of an honourable resistance
which centred in a few of the very oldest patrician families.<a id='r508'></a><a href='#f508' class='c019'><sup>[508]</sup></a> The god-figures
as such, as bodies, vanished from the consciousness of men, to make way
for a transcendental god-feeling which no longer depended on sense-evidences;
and the usages, festivals and legends melted into one another. When in 217
Caracalla put an end to all sacral-legal distinctions between Roman and foreign
deities and Isis, absorbing all older female numina, became actually the first
goddess of Rome<a id='r509'></a><a href='#f509' class='c019'><sup>[509]</sup></a> (and thereby the most dangerous opponent of Christianity
and the most obnoxious target for the hatred of the Fathers), then Rome became
a piece of the East, a religious diocese of Syria. Then the Baals of Doliche,
Petra, Palmyra and Edessa began to melt into the monotheism of Sol, who became
and remained (till his representative Licinius fell before Constantine) God
of the Empire. By now, the question was not between Classical and Magian—Christianity
was in so little danger from the old gods that it could offer them
a sort of sympathy—but it was, which of the Magian religions should dictate
religious form to the world of the Classical Empire? The decline of the old
plastic feeling is very clearly discernible in the stages through which Emperor-worship
passed—first, the dead emperor taken into the circle of State gods by
resolution of the Senate (Divus Julius, 42 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>), a priesthood provided for him
and his image removed from amongst the ancestor-images that were carried in
purely domestic celebrations; then, from Marcus Aurelius, no further consecrations
of priests (and, presently, no further building of temples) for the service of
deified emperors, for the reason that religious sentiment was now satisfied by a
general <span lang="la">“templum divorum”</span>; finally, the epithet Divus used simply as a <em>title</em>
of members of the Imperial family. This end to the evolution marks the victory
of the Magian feeling. It will be found that multiple names in the inscriptions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>(such as Isis-Magna Mater-Juno-Astarte-Bellona, or Mithras-Sol Invictus-Helios)
come to signify titles of one sole existent Godhead.<a id='r510'></a><a href='#f510' class='c019'><sup>[510]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c026'>XI</h4>

<p class='c018'>Atheism is a subject that the psychologist and the student of religion have
hitherto regarded as scarcely worth careful investigation. Much has been
written and argued about it, and very roundly, by the free-thought martyr on
the one hand and the religious zealot on the other. But no one has had anything
to say about the <em>species</em> of atheism; or has treated it analytically as an
<em>individual and definite</em> phenomenon, positive and necessary and intensely symbolic;
or has realized how it is limited in time.</p>

<p class='c001'>Is “Atheism” the <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> constitution of a certain world-consciousness or is
it a voluntary self-expression? Is one born with it or converted to it? Does the
unconscious feeling that the cosmos has become godless bring in its train the
consciousness that it is so, the realization that "Great Pan is dead"? Are
there early atheists, for example in the Doric or the Gothic ages? Has this
thinker or that been denounced as atheist with injustice as well as with passion?
And can there be civilized men who are <em>not</em> wholly or at any rate
partially atheist?</p>

<p class='c001'>It is not in dispute (the word itself shows it in all languages) that atheism
is essentially a negation, that it signifies the foregoing of a spiritual idea and
therefore the precedence of such an idea, and that it is not the creative act of an
unimpaired formative power. But what is it that it denies? In what way?
And who is the denier?</p>

<p class='c001'>Atheism, rightly understood, is the necessary expression of a spirituality
that has accomplished itself and exhausted its religious possibilities, and is
declining into the inorganic. It is entirely compatible with a living wistful
desire for real religiousness<a id='r511'></a><a href='#f511' class='c019'><sup>[511]</sup></a>—therein resembling Romanticism, which likewise
would recall that which has irrevocably gone, namely, the Culture—and
it may quite well be in a man as a creation of his feeling without his being
aware of it, without its ever interfering with the habits of his thought or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>challenging his convictions. We can understand this if we can see what it
was that made the devout Haydn call Beethoven an atheist after he had
heard some of his music. Atheism comes not with the evening of the Culture
but with the dawn of the Civilization. It belongs to the great city, to the
“educated man” of the great city who acquires mechanistically what his forefathers
the creators of the Culture had lived organically. In respect of the
Classical feeling of God, Aristotle is an atheist unawares. The Hellenistic-Roman
Stoicism is atheistic like the Socialism of Western and the Buddhism
of Indian modernity, reverently though they may and do use the word
“God.”</p>

<p class='c001'>But, if this late form of world-feeling and world-image which preludes our
“second religiousness” is universally a negation of the religious in us, the
structure of it is different in each of the Civilizations. There is no religiousness
that is without an atheistic opposition belonging uniquely to itself and directed
uniquely against itself. Men continue to experience the outer world that extends
around them as a cosmos of well-ordered bodies or a world-cavern or
efficient space, as the case may be, but they no longer livingly experience the
sacred causality in it. They only learn to know it in a profane causality that is,
or is desired to be, inclusively mechanical.<a id='r512'></a><a href='#f512' class='c019'><sup>[512]</sup></a> There are atheisms of Classical,
Arabian and Western kinds and these differ from one another in meaning and
in matter. Nietzsche formulated the dynamic atheism on the basis that “God
is dead,” and a Classical philosopher would have expressed the static and
Euclidean by saying that the “gods who dwell in the holy places are dead,”
the one indicating that boundless space has, the other that countless bodies
have, become godless. But <em>dead</em> space and <em>dead</em> things are the “facts” of
physics. The atheist is unable to experience any difference between the
Nature-picture of physics and that of religion. Language, with a fine feeling,
distinguishes wisdom and intelligence—the early and the late, the rural
and the megalopolitan conditions of the soul. Intelligence even sounds atheistic.
No one would describe Heraclitus or Meister Eckart as an intelligence,
but Socrates and Rousseau were intelligent and not “wise” men. There is
something root-less in the word. It is only from the standpoint of the Stoic
and of the Socialist, of the typical irreligious man, that want of intelligence
is a matter for contempt.</p>

<p class='c001'>The spiritual in every living Culture is religious, has religion, whether it be
conscious of it or not. That it exists, becomes, develops, fulfils itself, <em>is</em> its
religion. It is not open to a spirituality to be irreligious; at most it can play
with the idea of irreligion as Medicean Florentines did. But the megalopolitan
<em>is</em> irreligious; this is part of his being, a mark of his historical position. Bitterly
as he may feel the inner emptiness and poverty, earnestly as he may long to be
religious, it is out of his power to be so. All religiousness in the Megalopolis
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>rests upon self-deception. The degree of piety of which a period is capable is
revealed in its attitude <a id='corr410.2'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='torwards'>towards</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_410.2'>towards</a></span> toleration. One tolerates, either because the
form-language appears to be expressing something of that which in one’s own
lived experience is felt as divine, or else because that experience no longer
contains <em>anything</em> so felt.</p>

<p class='c001'>What we moderns have called “Toleration” in the Classical world<a id='r513'></a><a href='#f513' class='c019'><sup>[513]</sup></a> is an
expression of the <em>contrary</em> of atheism. Plurality of numina and cults is inherent
in the conception of Classical religion, and it was not toleration but the self-evident
expression of antique piety that allowed validity to them all. Conversely,
anyone who demanded exceptions showed himself <span lang="la"><i>ipso facto</i></span> as godless.
Christians and Jews counted, and necessarily counted, as atheists in the
eyes of anyone whose world-picture was an aggregate of individual bodies;
and when in Imperial times they ceased to be regarded in this light, the old
Classical god-feeling had itself come to an end. On the other hand, respect for
the form of the local cult whatever this might be, for images of the gods,
for sacrifices and festivals was always expected, and anyone who mocked or
profaned them very soon learned the limits of Classical toleration—witness
the scandal of the Mutilation of the Hermae at Athens and trials for the desecration
of the Eleusinian mysteries, that is, impious travestying of the sensuous
element. But to the Faustian soul (again we see opposition of space and body,
of conquest and acceptance of presence) <em>dogma</em> and not visible ritual constitutes
the essence. What is regarded as godless is opposition to doctrine. Here begins
the spatial-spiritual conception of heresy. A Faustian religion by its very
nature cannot allow any freedom of conscience; it would be in contradiction
with its space-invasive dynamic. Even free thinking itself is no exception to
the rule. After the stake, the guillotine; after the burning of the books, their
suppression; after the power of the pulpit, the power of the Press. Amongst us
there is no faith without leanings to an Inquisition of some sort. Expressed in
<em>appropriate</em> electrodynamic imagery, the field of force of a conviction adjusts
all the minds within it according to its own intensity. Failure to do so means
absence of conviction—in ecclesiastical language, ungodliness. For the Apollinian
soul, on the contrary, it was contempt of the cult—ἀσέβεια in the literal
sense—that was ungodly, and here its religion admitted no freedom of <em>attitude</em>.
In both cases there was a line drawn between the toleration demanded by the
god-feeling and that forbidden by it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now, here the Late-Classical philosophy of Sophist-Stoic speculation (as
distinct from the general Stoic disposition) was in opposition to religious
feeling. And accordingly we find the people of Athens—that Athens which
could build altars to “unknown gods”—persecuting as pitilessly as the
Spanish Inquisition. We have only to review the list of Classical thinkers and
historical personages who were sacrificed to the integrity of the cult. Socrates
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>and Diagoras were executed for ἀσέβεια; Anaxagoras, Protagoras, Aristotle,
Alcibiades only saved themselves by flight. The number of executions for cult-impiety,
in Athens alone and during the few decades of the Peloponnesian War,
ran into hundreds. After the condemnation of Protagoras, a house-to-house
search was made for the destruction of his writings. In Rome, acts of this sort
began (so far as history enables us to trace them) in 181 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> when the Senate
ordered the public burning of the Pythagorean “Books of Numa.”<a id='r514'></a><a href='#f514' class='c019'><sup>[514]</sup></a> This was
followed by an uninterrupted series of expulsions, both of individual philosophers
and of whole schools, and later by executions and by public burnings of
books regarded as subversive of religion. For instance, in the time of Cæsar
alone, the places of worship of Isis were five times destroyed by order of the
Consuls, and Tiberius had her image thrown into the Tiber. The refusal to
perform sacrifice before the image of the Emperor was made a penal offence.
All these were measures against “atheism,” in the <em>Classical</em> sense of the word,
manifested in theoretical or practical contempt of the visible cult. Unless we
can put our Western feeling of these matters out of action we shall never
penetrate into the essence of the world-image that underlay the Classical
attitude to them. Poets and philosophers might spin myths and transform
god-figures as much as they pleased. The dogmatic interpretation of the sensuous
data was everyone’s liberty. The <em>histories</em> of the gods could be made fun of
in Satyric drama and comedy—even that did not impugn their Euclidean
existence. But the statue of the god, the cult, the plastic embodiment of piety—it
was not permitted to any man to touch these. It was not out of hypocrisy
that the fine minds of the earlier Empire, who had ceased to take a myth of
any kind seriously, punctiliously conformed to the public cults and, above all,
to the cult—deeply real for all classes—of the Emperor. And, on the other
hand, the poets and thinkers of the mature Faustian Culture were at liberty
“not to go to Church,” to avoid Confession, to stay at home on procession-days
and (in Protestant surroundings) to live without any relations with the
church whatever. But they were not free to touch points of dogma, for that
would have been dangerous within any confession and any sect, including,
once more and expressly, free-thought. The Roman Stoic, who without faith
in the mythology piously observed the ritual forms, has his counterpart in
those men of the Age of Enlightenment, like Lessing and Goethe, who disregarded
the rites of the Church but never doubted the “fundamental truths of
faith.”</p>

<h4 class='c026'>XII</h4>

<p class='c018'>If we turn back from Nature-feeling become form to Nature-knowledge
become system, we know God or the gods as the origin of the images by which
the intellect seeks to make the world-around comprehensible to itself. Goethe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>once remarked (to Riemer): “The Reason is as old as the World; even the child
has reason. But it is not applied in all times in the same way or to the same
objects. The earlier centuries had their ideas in intuitions of the fancy, but
ours bring them into notions. <em>The great views of Life were brought into shapes, into
Gods; to-day they are brought into notions.</em> Then the productive force was greater,
now the destructive force or art of separation.” The strong religiousness of
Newton’s mechanics<a id='r515'></a><a href='#f515' class='c019'><sup>[515]</sup></a> and the almost complete atheism of the formulations of
modern dynamics are of like colour, positive and negative of the same primary
feeling. A physical system of necessity has all the characters of the soul to
whose world-form it belongs. The Deism of the Baroque belongs with its
dynamics and its analytical geometry; its three basic principles, God, Freedom
and Immortality, are in the language of mechanics the principles of inertia
(Galileo), least action (D’Alembert) and the conservation of energy (J. R.
Mayer).</p>

<p class='c001'>That which nowadays we call quite generally physics is in reality an artifact
of the Baroque. At this stage the reader will not feel it as paradoxical to associate
the mode of representation which rests on the assumption of distant
forces and the (wholly un-Classical and anything but naïve) idea of action-at-a-distance,
attraction and repulsion of masses, specially with the Jesuit style of
architecture founded by Vignola, and to call it accordingly the Jesuit style of
physics; and I would likewise call the Infinitesimal Calculus, which of necessity
came into being just when and where it did, the Jesuit style of mathematic.
Within this style, a working hypothesis that deepens the technique of experimentation
is “correct”; for Loyola’s concern, like Newton’s, was not description
of Nature but <em>method</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Western physics is by its inward form dogmatic and not ritualistic (kultisch).
Its content is the <em>dogma of Force</em> as identical with space and distance, the
theory of the mechanical Act (as against the mechanical Posture) in space.
Consequently its tendency is persistently to overcome the apparent. Beginning
with a still quite Apollinian-sensuous classification of physics into the physics
of the eye (optics), of the ear (acoustics) and of the skin-sense (heat), it by
degrees eliminated all sense-impressions and replaced them by abstract systems
of relations; thus, under the influence of ideas concerning dynamical motion in
an æther, radiant heat is nowadays dealt with under the heading of “optics,”
a word which has ceased to have anything to do with the eye.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Force” is a mythical quantity, which does not arise out of scientific
experimentation but, on the contrary, defines the structure thereof <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span>.
It is only the Faustian conception of Nature that instead of a magnet thinks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>of a magnetism whose field of force includes a piece of iron, and instead of
luminous bodies thinks of radiant energy, and that imagines personifications
like “electricity,” “temperature” and “radioactivity.”<a id='r516'></a><a href='#f516' class='c019'><sup>[516]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>That this “force” or “energy” is really a numen stiffened into a concept
(and in nowise the result of scientific experience) is shown by the often overlooked
fact that the basic principle known as the First Law of Thermodynamics<a id='r517'></a><a href='#f517' class='c019'><sup>[517]</sup></a>
says nothing whatever about the nature of energy, and it is properly
speaking an incorrect (though psychologically most significant) assumption
that the idea of the “Conservation of Energy” is fixed in it. Experimental
measurement can in the nature of things only establish a <em>number</em>, which number
we have (significantly, again) named <em>work</em>. But the dynamical cast of our
thought demanded that this should be conceived as a <em>difference</em> of energy, although
the absolute value of energy is only a figment and can never be rendered
by a definite number. There always remains, therefore, an undefined additive
constant, as we call it; in other words, we always strive to maintain the image
of an energy that our inner eye has formed, although actual scientific practice
is not concerned with it.</p>

<p class='c001'>This being the provenance of the force-concept, it follows that we can no
more define it than we can define those other un-Classical words Will and Space.
There remains always a felt and intuitively-perceived remainder which makes
every personal definition an almost religious <em>creed</em> of its author. Every Baroque
scientist in this matter has his personal inner experience which he is trying to
clothe in words. Goethe, for instance, could never have defined his idea of a
world-force, but to himself it was a certainty. Kant called force the phenomenon
of an ent-in-itself: “we know substance in space, the body, only through
forces.” Laplace called it an unknown of which the workings are all that we
know, and Newton imagined immaterial forces at a distance. Leibniz spoke
of <span lang="la"><i>Vis viva</i></span> as a quantum which together with matter formed the unit that
he called the monad, and Descartes, with certain thinkers of the 18th Century,
was equally unwilling to draw fundamental distinctions between motion
and the moved. Beside <span lang="la"><i>potentia</i></span>, <span lang="la"><i>virtus</i></span>, <span lang="la"><i>impetus</i></span> we find even in Gothic times
peri-phrases such as <span lang="la"><i>conatus</i></span> and <span lang="la"><i>nisus</i></span>, in which the force and the releasing
cause are obviously not separated. We can, indeed, quite well differentiate
between Catholic, Protestant and Atheistic notions of force. But Spinoza, a
Jew and therefore, spiritually, a member of the Magian Culture, could not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>absorb the Faustian force-concept at all, and it has no place in his system.<a id='r518'></a><a href='#f518' class='c019'><sup>[518]</sup></a> And
it is an astounding proof of the secret power of root-ideas that Heinrich Hertz,
the only Jew amongst the great physicists of the recent past, was also the only
one of them who tried to resolve the dilemma of mechanics by <em>eliminating</em> the
idea of force.</p>

<p class='c001'>The force-dogma is the one and only theme of Faustian physics. That
branch of science which under the name of Statics has been passed from system
to system and century to century is a fiction. “Modern Statics” is in the same
position as “arithmetic” and “geometry,” which, if the literal and original
senses of the words be kept to, are void of meaning in modern analysis, empty
names bequeathed by Classical science and only preserved because our reverence
for all things Classical has hitherto debarred us from getting rid of them or
even recognizing their hollowness. There <em>is</em> no Western statics—that is, no
interpretation of mechanical facts that is natural to the Western spirit bases
itself on the ideas of form and substance, or even, for that matter, on the ideas
of space and mass otherwise than in connexion with those of time and force.<a id='r519'></a><a href='#f519' class='c019'><sup>[519]</sup></a>
The reader can test this in any department that he pleases. Even “temperature,”
which of all our physical magnitudes has the most plausible look of
being static, Classical and passive, only falls into its place in our system when
it is brought into a force-picture, viz., the picture of a quantity of heat made up
of ultra-swift subtle irregular motions of the atoms of a body, with temperature
as the <em>mean vis viva</em> of these atoms.</p>

<p class='c001'>The Late Renaissance imagined that it had revived the Archimedean physics
just as it believed that it was continuing the Classical sculpture. But in the
one case as in the other it was merely preparing for the forms of the Baroque,
and doing so out of the spirit of the Gothic. To this Statics belongs the picture-subject
as it is in Mantegna’s work and also in that of Signorelli, whose line
and attitude later generations regarded as stiff and cold. With Leonardo,
dynamics begins and in Rubens the movement of swelling bodies is already at
a maximum.</p>

<p class='c001'>As late as 1629 the spirit of Renaissance physics appears in the theory of
magnetism formulated by the Jesuit Nicolaus Cabeo. Conceived in the mould
of an Aristotelian idea of the world, it was (like Palladio’s work on architecture)
foredoomed to lead to nothing—not because it was “wrong” in itself
but because it was in contradiction with the Faustian Nature-feeling which,
freed from Magian leading-strings by the thinkers and researchers of the 14th
Century, now required forms of its very own for the expression of its world-knowledge.
Cabeo avoided the notions of force and mass and confined himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>to the Classical concepts of form and substance—in other words, he went
back from the architecture of Michelangelo’s last phase and of Vignola to that
of Michelozzo and Raphael—and the system which he formed was complete
and self-contained but without importance for the future. A magnetism conceived
as a state of individual bodies and not as a force in unbounded space was
incapable of symbolically satisfying the inner eye of Faustian man. What we
need is a theory of the Far, not one of the Near. Newton’s mathematical-mechanical
principles required to be made explicit as a dynamics pure and
entire, and this another Jesuit, Boscovich,<a id='r520'></a><a href='#f520' class='c019'><sup>[520]</sup></a> was the first to achieve in 1758.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even Galileo was still under the influence of the Renaissance feeling, to
which the opposition of force and mass, that was to produce, in architecture and
painting and music alike the element of grand movement, was something strange
and uncomfortable. He therefore limited the idea of force to contact-force
(impact) and his formulation did not go beyond conservation of momentum
(quantity of motion). He held fast to mere moved-ness and fought shy of any
passion of space, and it was left to Leibniz to develop—first in the course of
controversy and then positively by the application of his mathematical discoveries—the
idea of genuine <em>free and directional forces</em> (living force, activum
thema). The notion of conservation of momentum then gave way to that of
conservation of living forces, as quantitative number gave way to functional
number.</p>

<p class='c001'>The concept of mass, too, did not become definite until somewhat later.
In Galileo and Kepler its place is occupied by volume, and it was Newton who
distinctly conceived it as <em>functional</em>—the world as function of God. That mass
(defined nowadays as the constant relation between force and acceleration in
respect of a system of material points) should have no proportionate relation
whatever to volume was, in spite of the evidence of the planets, a conclusion
inacceptable to Renaissance feeling.</p>

<p class='c001'>But, even so, Galileo was forced to inquire into the <em>causes</em> of motion. In a
genuine Statics, working only with the notions of material and form, this
question would have had no meaning. For Archimedes displacement was a
matter of insignificance compared with form, which was the essence of all
corporeal existence; for, if space be Nonent, what efficient can there be external
to the body concerned? Things are not functions of motion, but they move
themselves. Newton it was who first got completely away from Renaissance
feeling and formed the notion of distant forces, the attraction and repulsion of
bodies across space itself. Distance is already in itself a force. The very idea
of it is so free from all sense-perceptible content that Newton himself felt
uncomfortable with it—in fact it mastered him and not he it. It was the spirit
of Baroque itself, with its bent towards infinite space, that had evoked this
<em>contrapuntal and utterly un-plastic</em> notion. And in it withal there was a contradiction.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>To this day no one has produced an adequate definition of these forces-at-a-distance.
No one has ever yet understood what centrifugal force really is.
Is the force of the earth rotating on its axis the cause of this motion or vice
versa? Or are the two identical? Is such a cause, considered <span lang="la"><i>per se</i></span>, a force or
another motion? What is the difference between force and motion? Suppose
the alterations in the planetary system to be workings of a centrifugal force;
that being so, the bodies ought to be slung out of their path [tangentially],
and as in fact they are not so, we must assume a centrifugal force as well. What
do all these words mean? It is just the impossibility of arriving at order and
clarity here that led Hertz to do away with the force-notion altogether and
(by highly artificial assumptions of rigid couplings between positions and
velocities) to reduce his system of mechanics to the principle of contact (impact).
But this merely conceals and does not remove the perplexities, which are
of intrinsically Faustian character and rooted in the very essence of dynamics.
“Can we speak of forces which owe their origin to motion?” Certainly not;
but can we get rid of <em>primary</em> notions that are <em>inborn</em> in the Western spirit though
indefinable? Hertz himself made no attempt to apply his system practically.</p>

<p class='c001'>This <em>symbolic</em> difficulty of modern mechanics is in no way removed by the
potential theory that was founded by Faraday when the centre of gravity of
physical thought had passed from the dynamics of matter to the electrodynamics
of the æther. The famous experimenter, who was a visionary through
and through—alone amongst the modern masters of physics he was not a
mathematician—observed in 1846: “I assume nothing to be true in any part
of space (whether this be empty as is commonly said, or filled with matter)
except forces and the lines in which they are exercised.” Here, plain enough, is
the directional tendency with its intimately organic and historic content, the
tendency in the knower to live the process of his knowing. Here Faraday is
metaphysically at one with Newton, whose forces-at-a-distance point to a
mythic background that the devout physicist declined to examine. The possible
alternative way of reaching an unequivocal definition of force—viz.,
that which starts from World and not God, from the object and not the subject
of natural motion-state—was leading at the very same time to the formulation
of the concept of Energy. Now, this concept represents, as distinct from that
of force, a quantum of directedness and not a direction, and is in so far akin to
Leibniz’s conception of “living force” unalterable in quantity. It will not
escape notice that essential features of the mass-concept have been taken over
here; indeed, even the bizarre notion of an atomic structure of energy has been
seriously discussed.</p>

<p class='c001'>This rearrangement of the basic words has not, however, altered the feeling
that a world-force with its substratum does exist. The motion-problem is as
insoluble as ever. All that has happened on the way from Newton to Faraday—or
from Berkeley to Mill—is that the religious deed-idea has been replaced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>by the irreligious work-idea.<a id='r521'></a><a href='#f521' class='c019'><sup>[521]</sup></a> In the Nature-picture of Bruno, Newton and
Goethe something divine is working itself out in acts, in that of modern physics
<em>Nature is doing work</em>; for every “process” within the meaning of the First Law
of Thermodynamics is or should be measurable by the expenditure of energy
to which a quantity of work corresponds in the form of “bound energy.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Naturally, therefore, we find the decisive discovery of J. R. Mayer coinciding
in time with the birth of the Socialist theory. Even economic
systems wield the same concepts; the value-problem has been in relation with
quantity of work<a id='r522'></a><a href='#f522' class='c019'><sup>[522]</sup></a>] ever since Adam Smith, who <span lang="fr"><i>vis-à-vis</i></span> Quesney and Turgot
marks the change from an organic to a mechanical structure of the economic
field. The “work” which is the foundation of modern economic theory has
purely dynamic meaning, and phrases could be found in the language of economists
which correspond exactly to the physical propositions of conservation
of energy, entropy and least action.</p>

<p class='c001'>If, then, we review the successive stages through which the central idea of
force has passed since its birth in the Baroque, and its intimate relations with
the form-worlds of the great arts and of mathematics, we find that (1) in the
17th Century (Galileo, Newton, Leibniz) it is pictorially formed and in unison
with the great art of oil-painting that died out about 1630; (2) in the 18th
Century (the “classical” mechanics of Laplace and Lagrange) it acquires the
abstract character of the fugue-style and is in unison with Bach; and (3) with
the Culture at its end and the civilized intelligence victorious over the spiritual,
it appears in the domain of pure analysis, and in particular in the theory of
functions of several complex variables, without which it is, in its most modern
form, scarcely understandable.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>XIII</h3>

<p class='c018'>But with this, it cannot be denied, the Western physics is drawing near to
the limit of its possibilities. At bottom, its mission as a historical phenomenon
has been to transform the Faustian Nature-feeling into an intellectual knowledge,
the faith-forms of springtime into the machine-forms of exact science.
And, though for the time being it will continue to quarry more and more
practical and even “purely theoretical” results, results as such, whatever their
kind, belong to the superficial history of a science. To its deeps belong only
the history of its symbolism and its style, and it is almost too evident to be
worth the saying that in those deeps the essence and nucleus of our science is
in rapid disintegration. Up to the end of the 19th Century every step was in the
direction of an inward fulfilment, an increasing purity, rigour and fullness of the
dynamic Nature-picture—and then, that which has brought it to an optimum
of theoretical clarity, suddenly becomes a <em>solvent</em>. This is not happening intentionally—the
high intelligences of modern physics are, in fact, unconscious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>that it is happening at all—but from an inherent historic necessity. Just so,
at the same relative stage, the Classical science inwardly fulfilled itself about
200 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> Analysis reached its goal with Gauss, Cauchy and Riemann, and
to-day it is only filling up the gaps in its structure.</p>

<p class='c001'>This is the origin of the sudden and annihilating doubt that has arisen about
things that even yesterday were the unchallenged foundation of physical theory,
about the meaning of the energy-principle, the concepts of mass, space, absolute
time, and causality-laws generally. This doubt is no longer the fruitful doubt
of the Baroque, which brought the knower and the object of his knowledge
together; it is a doubt affecting the very possibility of a Nature-science. To
take one instance alone, what a depth of unconscious Skepsis there is in the
rapidly-increasing use of enumerative and statistical methods, which aim only
at <em>probability</em> of results and forgo in advance the absolute scientific exactitude
that was a creed to the hopeful earlier generations.</p>

<p class='c001'>The moment is at hand now, when the possibility of a self-contained and
self-consistent mechanics will be given up for good. Every physics, as I have
shown, must break down over the motion-problem, in which the living person
of the knower methodically intrudes into the inorganic form-world of the
known. But to-day, not only is this dilemma still inherent in all the newest
theories but three centuries of intellectual work have brought it so sharply
to focus that there is no possibility more of ignoring it. The theory of gravitation,
which since Newton has been an impregnable truth, has now been recognized
as a temporally limited and shaky hypothesis. The principle of the
Conservation of Energy has no meaning if energy is supposed to be infinite in
an infinite space. The acceptance of the principle is incompatible with any
three-dimensional structure of space, whether infinite or Euclidean or (as the
Non-Euclidean geometries present it) spherical and of “finite, yet unbounded”
volume. Its validity therefore is restricted to “a system of bodies self-contained
and not externally influenced” and such a limitation does not and cannot exist
in actuality. But symbolic infinity was just what the Faustian world-feeling
had meant to express in this basic idea, which was simply <em>the mechanical and
extensional re-ideation of the idea of immortality and world-soul</em>. In fact it was a feeling
out of which knowledge could never succeed in forming a pure system. The
luminiferous æther, again, was an ideal postulate of modern dynamics whereby
every motion required a something-to-be-moved, but every conceivable hypothesis
concerning the constitution of this æther has broken down under inner
contradictions; more, Lord Kelvin has proved mathematically that there <em>can</em>
be no structure of this light-transmitter that is not open to objections. As,
according to the interpretation of Fresnel’s experiments, the light-waves are
transversal, the æther would have to be a rigid body (with truly quaint properties),
but then the laws of elasticity would have to apply to it and in that case
the waves would be longitudinal. The Maxwell-Hertz equations of the Electro-magnetic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>Theory of Light, which in fact are pure nameless numbers of indubitable
validity, exclude the explanation of the æther by any mechanics whatsoever.
Therefore, and having regard also to the consequences of the Relativity
theory, physicists now regard the æther as pure vacuum. But that, after all,
is not very different from demolishing the dynamic picture itself.</p>

<p class='c001'>Since Newton, the assumption of constant mass—the counterpart of constant
force—has had uncontested validity. But the Quantum theory of Planck,
and the conclusions of Niels Bohr therefrom as to the fine structure of atoms,
which experimental experience had rendered necessary, have destroyed this
assumption. Every self-contained system possesses, besides kinetic energy, an
energy of radiant heat which is inseparable from it and therefore cannot be
represented purely by the concept of mass. For if mass is defined by living
energy it is <span lang="la"><i>ipso facto</i></span> no longer constant with reference to thermodynamic state.
Nevertheless, it is impossible to fit the theory of quanta into the group of hypotheses
constituting the “classical” mechanics of the Baroque; moreover,
along with the principle of causal continuity, the basis of the Infinitesimal Calculus
founded by Newton and Leibniz is threatened.<a id='r523'></a><a href='#f523' class='c019'><sup>[523]</sup></a> But, if these are serious
enough doubts, the ruthlessly cynical hypothesis of the Relativity theory
strikes to the very heart of dynamics. Supported by the experiments of A. A.
Michelson, which showed that the velocity of light remains unaffected by the
motion of the medium, and prepared mathematically by Lorentz and Minkowski,
its specific tendency is to <em>destroy the notion of absolute time</em>. Astronomical discoveries
(and here present-day scientists are seriously deceiving themselves) can
neither establish nor refute it. “Correct” and “incorrect” are not the criteria
whereby such assumptions are to be tested; the question is whether, in the chaos
of involved and artificial ideas that has been produced by the innumerable hypotheses
of Radioactivity and Thermodynamics, it can hold its own as a <em>useable</em>
hypothesis or not. But however this may be, <em>it has abolished the constancy of those
physical quantities into the definition of which time has entered</em>, and unlike the antique
statics, the Western dynamics knows <em>only</em> such quantities. Absolute measures
of length and rigid bodies are no more. And with this the possibility of
absolute quantitative delimitations and therefore the “classical” concept of
mass as the constant ratio between force and acceleration fall to the ground—just
after the quantum of action, a product of energy and time, had been set
up as a new constant.</p>

<p class='c001'>If we make it clear to ourselves that the atomic ideas of Rutherford and
Bohr<a id='r524'></a><a href='#f524' class='c019'><sup>[524]</sup></a> signify nothing but this, that the numerical results of observations
have suddenly been provided with a picture of a planetary world within the
atom, instead of that of atom-swarms hitherto favoured; if we observe how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>rapidly card-houses of hypothesis are run up nowadays, every contradiction
being immediately covered up by a new hurried hypothesis; if we reflect on
how little heed is paid to the fact that these images contradict one another and
the “classical” Baroque mechanics alike, we cannot but realize that the <em>great
style of ideation is at an end</em> and that, as in architecture and the arts of form, a
sort of craft-art of hypothesis-building has taken its place. Only our extreme
maestria in experimental technique—true child of its century—hides the
collapse of the symbolism.</p>

<h4 class='c026'>XIV</h4>

<p class='c018'>Amongst these symbols of decline, the most conspicuous is the notion of
Entropy, which forms the subject of the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The
first law, that of the conservation of energy, is the plain formulation of the
essence of dynamics—not to say of the constitution of the West-European
soul, to which Nature is necessarily visible only in the form of a contrapuntal-dynamic
causality (as against the static-plastic causality of Aristotle). The
basic element of the Faustian world-picture is not the Attitude but the Deed
and, mechanically considered, the Process, and this law merely puts the
mathematical character of these processes into form as variables and constants.
But the Second Law goes deeper, and shows a <em>bias</em> in Nature-happenings which
is in no wise imposed <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span> by the conceptual fundamentals of dynamics.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mathematically, Entropy is represented by a quantity which is fixed by
the momentary state of a self-contained system of bodies and under all
physical and chemical alterations can only increase, never diminish; in the
most favourable conditions it remains unchanged. Entropy, like Force and
Will, is something which (to anyone for whom this form-world is accessible
at all) is inwardly clear and meaningful, but is formulated differently by every
different authority and never satisfactorily by any. Here again, the intellect
breaks down where the world-feeling demands expression.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nature-processes in general have been classified as irreversible and reversible,
according as entropy is increased or not. In any process of the first kind, free
energy is converted into bound energy, and if this dead energy is to be turned
once more into living, this can only occur through the simultaneous binding of
a further quantum of living energy in some second process; the best-known
example is the combustion of coal—that is, the conversion of the living
energy stored up in it into heat bound by the gas form of the carbon dioxide,
if the latent energy of water is to be translated into steam-pressure and thereafter
into motion.<a id='r525'></a><a href='#f525' class='c019'><sup>[525]</sup></a> It follows that in the world as a whole entropy continually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>increases; that is, the dynamic system is manifestly approaching to some final
state, whatever this may be. Examples of the irreversible processes are conduction
of heat, diffusion, friction, emission of light and chemical reactions;
of reversible, gravitation, electric oscillations, electromagnetic waves and
sound-waves.</p>

<p class='c001'>What has never hitherto been fully felt, and what leads me to regard the
Entropy theory (1850) as the beginning of the destruction of that masterpiece of
Western intelligence, the old dynamic physics, is the deep opposition of theory
and actuality which is here for the first time introduced into theory itself.
The First Law had drawn the strict picture of a causal Nature-happening, but
the Second Law by introducing irreversibility has for the first time brought into
the mechanical-logical domain a tendency belonging to immediate life and
thus in fundamental contradiction with the very essence of that domain.</p>

<p class='c001'>If the Entropy theory is followed out to its conclusion, it results, <em>firstly</em>,
that in theory all processes must be reversible—which is one of the basic
postulates of dynamics and is reasserted with all rigour in the law of the
Conservation of Energy—but, <em>secondly</em>, that in actuality processes of Nature
in their entirety are irreversible. Not even under the artificial conditions of
laboratory experiment can the simplest process be exactly reversed, that is,
a state once passed cannot be re-established. Nothing is more significant of
the present condition of systematics than the introduction of the hypotheses
of “elementary disorder” for the purpose of smoothing-out the contradiction
between intellectual postulate and actual experience. The “smallest particles”
of a body (an image, no more) throughout perform reversible processes, but in
actual things the smallest particles are in disorder and mutually interfere; and
so the irreversible process that alone is experienced by the observer is linked
with increase of entropy by taking the mean probabilities of occurrences. And
thus theory becomes a chapter of the Calculus of Probabilities, and in lieu
of exact we have statistical methods.</p>

<p class='c001'>Evidently, the significance of this has passed unnoticed. Statistics belong,
like chronology, to the domain of the organic, to fluctuating Life, to Destiny
and Incident and not to the world of laws and timeless causality. As everyone
knows, statistics serve above all to characterize political and economic, that is,
historical, developments. In the “classical” mechanics of Galileo and Newton
there would have been no room for them. And if, now, suddenly the contents
of that field are supposed to be understood and understandable only statistically
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>and under the aspect of Probability—instead of under that of the <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span>
exactitude which the Baroque thinkers unanimously demanded—what does
it mean? It means that the object of understanding is ourselves. The Nature
“known” in this wise is the Nature that we know by way of living experience,
that we live in ourselves. What <em>theory</em> asserts (and, being itself, must assert)—to
wit, this ideal irreversibility that never happens in actuality—represents a
relic of the old severe intellectual form, the great Baroque tradition that had
contrapuntal music for twin sister. But the resort to statistics shows that the
force that that tradition regulated and made effective is exhausted. Becoming
and Become, Destiny and Causality, historical and natural-science elements are
beginning to be confused. Formulæ of life, growth, age, direction and death
are crowding up.</p>

<p class='c001'>That is what, from this point of view, irreversibility in world-processes has
to mean. It is the expression, no longer of the physical “t” but of genuine
<em>historical</em>, inwardly-experienced Time, which is identical with Destiny.</p>

<p class='c001'>Baroque physics was, root and branch, a <em>strict systematic</em> and remained so
for as long as its structure was not racked by theories like these, as long as its
field was absolutely free from anything that expressed accident and mere probability.
But directly these theories come up, it becomes <em>physiognomic</em>. “The
course of the world” is followed out. The idea of the end of the world appears,
under the veil of formulæ that are no longer in their essence formulæ at all.
Something Goethian has entered into physics—and if we understand the
deeper significance of Goethe’s passionate polemic against Newton in the <span lang="la">“Farbenlehre”</span><a id='r526'></a><a href='#f526' class='c019'><sup>[526]</sup></a>
we shall realize the full weight of what this means. For therein
intuitive vision was arguing against reason, life against death, creative image
against normative law. The critical form-world of Nature-<em>knowledge</em> came out
of Nature-<em>feeling</em>, God-feeling, as the evoked contrary. Here, at the end of
the Late period, it has reached the maximal distance and is turning to come
home.</p>

<p class='c001'>So, once more, the imaging-power that is the efficient in dynamics conjures
up the old great symbol of Faustian man’s historical passion, Care—the outlook
into the farthest far of past and future, the back-looking study of history,
the foreseeing state, the confessions and introspections, the bells that sounded
over all our country-sides and measured the passing of Life. The ethos of the
word Time, as we alone feel it, as instrumental music alone and no statue-plastic
can carry it, is directed upon an <em>aim</em>. This aim has been figured in every
life-image that the West has conceived—as the Third Kingdom, as the New
Age, as the task of mankind, as the issue of evolution. And it is figured, as the
destined end-state of all Faustian “Nature,” in Entropy.</p>

<p class='c001'>Directional feeling, a relation of past and future, is implicit already in the
mythic concept of force on which the whole of this dogmatic form-world
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>rests, and in the description of natural processes it emerges distinct. It would
not be too much, therefore, to say that entropy, as the intellectual form in
which the infinite sum of nature-events is assembled as a <em>historical and physiognomic</em>
unit, tacitly underlay all physical concept-formation from the outset,
so that when it came out (as one day it was bound to come out) it was as a
“discovery” of scientific <em>induction</em> claiming “support” from all the other
theoretical elements of the system. The more dynamics exhausts its inner
possibilities as it nears the goal, the more decidedly the historical characters
in the picture come to the front and the more insistently the organic necessity
of Destiny asserts itself side by side with the inorganic necessity of Causality,
and Direction makes itself felt along with capacity and intensity, the factors
of pure extension. The course of this process is marked by the appearance of
whole series of daring hypotheses, all of like sort, which are only apparently
demanded by experimental results and which in fact world-feeling and mythology
imagined as long ago as the Gothic age.</p>

<p class='c001'>Above all, this is manifested in the bizarre hypotheses of atomic disintegration
which elucidate the phenomena of radioactivity, and according to which
uranium atoms that have kept their essence unaltered, in spite of all external
influences, for millions of years and then suddenly without assignable cause
explode, scattering their smallest particles over space with velocities of thousands
of kilometres per second. Only a few individuals in an aggregate of
radioactive atoms are struck by Destiny thus, the neighbours being entirely
unaffected. Here too, then, is a picture of history and not “Nature,” and
although statistical methods here also prove to be necessary, one might almost
say that in them mathematical number has been replaced by chronological.<a id='r527'></a><a href='#f527' class='c019'><sup>[527]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>With ideas like these, the mythopoetic force of the Faustian soul is returning
to its origins. It was at the outset of the Gothic, just at the time when the
first mechanical clocks were being built, that the myth of the world’s end,
Ragnarök, the Twilight of the Gods, arose. It may be that, like all the reputedly
old-German myths Ragnarök (whether in the Völuspa form or as the
Christian Muspilli) was modelled more or less on Classical and particularly
Christian-Apocalyptic motives. Nevertheless, it is the expression and symbol
of the Faustian and of no other soul. The Olympian college is historyless, it
knows no becoming, no epochal moments, no aim. But the passionate thrust
into distance is Faustian. Force, Will, has an aim, and where there is an aim
there is for the inquiring eye an end. That which the perspective of oil-painting
expressed by means of the vanishing point, the Baroque park by its <span lang="fr"><i>point de vue</i></span>,
and analysis by the <i>n</i>th term of an infinite series—the conclusion, that is, of
a willed directedness—assumes here the form of the concept. The Faust
of the Second Part is dying, for he has reached his goal. What the myth of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>Götterdämmerung signified of old, the irreligious form of it, the theory of
Entropy, signifies to-day—<i>world’s end as completion of an inwardly necessary
evolution</i>.</p>

<h4 class='c021'>XV</h4>

<p class='c018'>It remains now to sketch the last stage of Western science. From our standpoint
of to-day, the gently-sloping route of decline is clearly visible.</p>

<p class='c001'>This too, the power of looking ahead to inevitable Destiny, is part of the
historical capacity that is the peculiar endowment of the Faustian. The Classical
died, as we shall die, but it died unknowing. It believed in an eternal
Being and to the last it lived its days with frank satisfaction, each day spent as
a gift of the gods. But we know our history. Before us there stands a last
spiritual crisis that will involve all Europe and America. What its course will
be, Late Hellenism tells us. The tyranny of the Reason—of which we are
not conscious, for we are ourselves its apex—is in every Culture an epoch
between man and old-man, and no more. Its most distinct expression is the
cult of exact sciences, of dialectic, of demonstration, of causality. Of old the
Ionic, and in our case the Baroque were its rising limb, and now the question
is what form will the down-curve assume?</p>

<p class='c001'>In this very century, I prophesy, the century of scientific-critical Alexandrianism,
of the great harvests, of the final formulations, a new element of inwardness
will arise to overthrow the will-to-victory of science. Exact science must
presently fall upon its own keen sword. First, in the 18th Century, its methods
were tried out, then, in the 19th, its powers, and now its historical rôle is
critically reviewed. But from Skepsis there is a path to “second religiousness,”
which is the sequel and not the preface of the Culture. Men dispense with
proof, desire only to believe and not to dissect.</p>

<p class='c001'>The individual renounces by laying aside books. The Culture renounces by
ceasing to manifest itself in high scientific intellects. But science exists only
in the living thought of great savant-generations, and books are nothing if
they are not living and effective in men worthy of them. Scientific results are
merely items of an intellectual tradition. It constitutes the death of a science
that no one any longer regards it as an event, and an orgy of two centuries of
exact scientific-ness brings satiety. Not the individual, the soul of the Culture
itself has had enough, and it expresses this by putting into the field of the day
ever smaller, narrower and more unfruitful investigators. The great century of
the Classical science was the third, after the death of Aristotle; when Archimedes
died and the Romans came, it was already almost at its end. Our great century
has been the 19th. Savants of the calibre of Gauss and Humboldt and
Helmholtz were already no more by 1900. In physics as in chemistry, in biology
as in mathematics, the great masters are dead, and we are now experiencing
the <em>decrescendo</em> of brilliant gleaners who arrange, collect and finish-off like the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>Alexandrian scholars of the Roman age. Everything that does not belong to
the matter-of-fact side of life—to politics, technics or economics—exhibits
the common symptom. After Lysippus no great sculptor, no artist as man-of-destiny,
appears, and after the Impressionists no painter, and after Wagner no
musician. The age of Cæsarism needed neither art nor philosophy. To Eratosthenes
and Archimedes, true creators, succeed Posidonius and Pliny, collectors
of taste, and finally Ptolemy and Galen, mere copyists. And, just as oil-painting
and instrumental music ran through their possibilities in a few centuries, so
also dynamics, which began to bud about 1600, is to-day in the grip of
decay.</p>

<p class='c001'>But before the curtain falls, there is one more task for the historical Faustian
spirit, a task not yet specified, hitherto not even imagined as possible. There
has still to be written a <em>morphology of the exact sciences</em>, which shall discover how
all laws, concepts and theories inwardly hang together as forms and what they
have meant as such in the life-course of the Faustian Culture. The re-treatment
of theoretical physics, of chemistry, of mathematics as a sum of symbols—this
will be the definitive conquest of the mechanical world-aspect by an intuitive,
once more religious, world-outlook, a last master-effort of physiognomic
to break down even systematic and to absorb it, as expression and symbol, into
its own domain. One day we shall no longer ask, as the 19th Century asked,
what are the valid laws underlying chemical affinity or diamagnetism—rather,
we shall be amazed indeed that minds of the first order could ever have been
completely preoccupied by questions such as these. We shall inquire whence
came these forms that were prescribed for the Faustian spirit, why they had to
come to our kind of humanity particularly and exclusively, and what deep
meaning there is in the fact that the numbers that we have won became phenomenal
in just this picture-like disguise. And, be it said, we have to-day
hardly yet an inkling of how much in our reputedly objective values and
experiences is only disguise, only image and expression.</p>

<p class='c001'>The separate sciences—epistemology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, astronomy—are
approaching one another with acceleration, converging towards
a complete identity of results. The issue will be a fusion of the form-worlds,
which will present on the one hand a system of numbers, functional in nature
and reduced to a few ground-formulæ, and on the other a small group of theories,
denominators to those numerators, which in the end will be seen to be
myths of the springtime under modern veils, reducible therefore—and at
once of necessity reduced—to picturable and physiognomically significant
characters that are the fundamentals. This convergence has not yet been
observed, for the reason that since Kant—indeed, since Leibniz—there has
been no philosopher who commanded the problems of <em>all</em> the exact sciences.</p>

<p class='c001'>Even a century ago, physics and chemistry were foreign to one another, but
to-day they cannot be handled separately—witness spectrum analysis, radioactivity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>radiation of heat. Fifty years ago the essence of chemistry could still
be described almost without mathematics, and to-day the chemical elements
are in course of volatilizing themselves into the mathematical constants of
variable relation-complexes, and with the sense-comprehensibility of the elements
goes the last trace of magnitude as the term is Classically and plastically
understood. Physiology is becoming a chapter of organic chemistry and is
making use of the methods of the Infinitesimal Calculus. The branch of the
older physics—distinguished, according to the bodily senses concerned in each,
as acoustics, optics and heat—have melted into a dynamic of matter and a
dynamic of the æther, and these again can no longer keep their frontiers mathematically
clear. The last discussions of epistemology are now uniting with
those of higher analysis and theoretical physics to occupy an almost inaccessible
domain, the domain to which, for example, the theory of Relativity
belongs or ought to belong. The sign-language in which the emanation-theory
of radioactivity expresses itself is completely de-sensualized.</p>

<p class='c001'>Chemistry, once concerned with defining as sharply as possible the qualities
of elements, such as valency, weight, affinity and reactivity, is setting to work
to get rid of these sensible traits. The elements are held to differ in character
according to their derivation from this or that compound. They are represented
to be complexes of different units which indeed behave (“actually”) as units
of a higher order and are not practically separable but show deep differences
in point of radioactivity. Through the emanation of radiant energy degradation
is always going on, so that we can speak of the <em>lifetime</em> of an element, in
formal contradiction with the original concept of the element and the spirit
of modern chemistry as created by Lavoisier. All these tendencies are bringing
the ideas of chemistry very close to the theory of Entropy, with its suggestive
opposition of causality and destiny, Nature and History. And they indicate
the paths that our science is pursuing—on the one hand, towards the discovery
that its logical and numerical results are identical with the structure
of the reason itself, and, on the other, towards the revelation that the whole
theory which clothes these numbers merely represents the symbolic expression
of Faustian life.</p>

<p class='c001'>And here, as our study draws to its conclusion, we must mention the truly
Faustian theory of “aggregates,” one of the weightiest in all this form-world
of our science. In sharpest antithesis to the older mathematic, it deals, not
with singular quantities but with the aggregates constituted by all quantities
[or objects] having this or that specified morphological similarity—for instance
all square numbers or all differential equations of a given type. Such an
aggregate it conceives as a new unit, a new <em>number of higher order</em>, and subjecting
it to criteria of new and hitherto quite unsuspected kinds such as “potency,”
“order,” “equivalence,” “countableness,” and devising laws and operative
methods for it in respect of these criteria. Thus is being actualized a last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>extension of the function-theory.<a id='r528'></a><a href='#f528' class='c019'><sup>[528]</sup></a> Little by little this absorbed the whole of
our mathematic, and now it is dealing with variables by the principles of the
Theory of Groups in respect of the character of the function and by those of
the Theory of Aggregates in respect of the values of the variables. Mathematical
philosophy is well aware that these ultimate meditations on the
nature of number are fusing with those upon pure logic, and an algebra of
logic is talked of. The study of geometrical axioms has become a chapter of
epistemology.</p>

<p class='c001'>The aim to which all this is striving, and which in particular every Nature-researcher
feels in himself as an impulse, is the achievement of a pure numerical
transcendence, the complete and inclusive conquest of the visibly apparent and
its replacement by a language of imagery unintelligible to the layman and
impossible of sensuous realization—but a language that the great Faustian
symbol of Infinite space endows with the dignity of inward necessity. The
deep scepticism of these final judgments links the soul anew to the forms of
early Gothic religiousness. The inorganic, known and dissected world-around,
the World as Nature and System, has deepened itself until it is a pure sphere
of functional numbers. But, as we have seen, number is one of the most primary
symbols in every Culture; and consequently the way to pure number is the
return of the waking consciousness to its own secret, the revelation of its own
formal necessity. The goal reached, the vast and ever more meaningless and
threadbare fabric woven around natural science falls apart. It was, after all,
nothing but the inner structure of the “Reason,” the grammar by which it
believed it could overcome the Visible and extract therefrom the True. But
what appears under the fabric is once again the earliest and deepest, the Myth,
the immediate Becoming, Life itself. The less anthropomorphic science believes
itself to be, the more anthropomorphic it is. One by one it gets rid of the
<em>separate</em> human traits in the Nature-picture, only to find at the end that the
supposed pure Nature which it holds in its hand is—humanity itself, pure and
complete. Out of the Gothic soul grew up, till it overshadowed the religious
world-picture, the spirit of the City, the alter ego of irreligious Nature-science.
But now, in the sunset of the scientific epoch and the rise of victorious Skepsis,
the clouds dissolve and the quiet landscape of the morning reappears in all
distinctness.</p>

<p class='c001'>The final issue to which the Faustian wisdom tends—though it is only in
the highest moments that it has seen it—is the dissolution of all knowledge
into a vast system of morphological relationships. Dynamics and Analysis are in
respect of meaning, form-language and substance, identical with Romanesque
ornament, Gothic cathedrals, Christian-German dogma and the dynastic state.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>One and the same world-feeling speaks in all of them. They were born with,
and they aged with, the Faustian Culture, and they present that Culture in the
world of day and space as a historical drama. The uniting of the several scientific
aspects into one will bear all the marks of the great art of counterpoint.
<em>An infinitesimal music of the boundless world-space</em>—that is the deep unresting
longing of this soul, as the orderly statuesque and Euclidean Cosmos was the
satisfaction of the Classical. That—formulated by a logical necessity of Faustian
reason as a dynamic-imperative causality, then developed into a dictatorial,
hard-working, world-transforming science—is the grand legacy of the
Faustian soul to the souls of Cultures yet to be, a bequest of immensely
transcendent forms that the heirs will possibly ignore. And then, weary after
its striving, the Western science returns to its spiritual home.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. Kant’s error, an error of very wide bearing which has not even yet been overcome, was first
of all in bringing the outer and inner Man into relation with the ideas of space and time by pure
scheme, though the meanings of these are numerous and, above all, not unalterable; and secondly in
allying arithmetic with the one and geometry with the other in an utterly mistaken way. It is not
between arithmetic and geometry—we must here anticipate a little—but between chronological
and mathematical number that there is fundamental opposition. Arithmetic and geometry are <em>both</em>
spatial mathematics and in their higher regions they are no longer separable. <em>Time-reckoning</em>, of
which the plain man is capable of a perfectly clear understanding through his senses, answers the
question “When,” not “What” or “How Many.”</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. The attempts of the Greeks to frame something like a calendar or a chronology after the
Egyptian fashion, besides being very belated indeed, were of extreme <span lang="fr"><i>naïveté</i></span>. The Olympiad reckoning
is not an era in the sense of, say, the Christian chronology, and is, moreover, a late and purely
literary expedient, without popular currency. The people, in fact, had no general need of a numeration
wherewith to date the experiences of their grandfathers and great-grandfathers, though a few
learned persons might be interested in the calendar question. We are not here concerned with the
soundness or unsoundness of a calendar, but with its currency, with the question of whether men
regulated their lives by it or not; but, incidentally, even the list of Olympian victors before 500 is
quite as much of an invention as the lists of earlier Athenian archons or Roman consuls. Of the
colonizations, we possess not one single authentic date (E. Meyer. <span lang="de"><cite>Gesch. d. Alt.</cite></span> II, 442. Beloch.
<span lang="de"><cite>Griech. Gesch.</cite></span> I, 2, 219) “in Greece before the fifth century, no one ever thought of noting or
reporting historical events.” (Beloch. I, 1, 125). We possess an inscription which sets forth a
treaty between Elis and Heraea which “was to be valid for a hundred years from this year.”
What “this year” was, is however not indicated. After a few years no one would have known
how long the treaty had still to run. Evidently this was a point that no one had taken into account
at the time—indeed, the very “men of the moment” who drew up the document, probably themselves
soon forgot. Such was the childlike, fairy-story character of the Classical presentation of
history that any ordered dating of the events of, say, the Trojan War (which occupies in their series
the same position as the Crusades in ours) would have been felt as a sheer solecism.</p>

<p class='c001'>Equally backward was the geographical science of the Classical world as compared with that of
the Egyptians and the Babylonians. E. Meyer (<span lang="de"><cite>Gesch. d. Alt.</cite></span> II, 102) shows how the Greeks’ knowledge
of the form of Africa degenerated from Herodotus (who followed Persian authorities) to
Aristotle. The same is true of the Romans as the heirs of the Carthaginians; they first repeated the
information of their alien forerunners and then slowly forgot it.</p>

that the Hellenes, though they had before their eyes the works of the Mycenæan Age and
their land was only too rich in stone, <em>deliberately reverted to wood</em>; hence the absence of architectural
remains of the period 1200-600. The Egyptian plant-column was from the outset of stone, whereas
the Doric column was wooden, a clear indication of the intense antipathy of the Classical soul towards
duration.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. Is there any Hellenic city that ever carried out one single comprehensive work that tells of
care for future generations? The road and water systems which research has assigned to the Mycenæan—i.e.,
the pre-Classical—age fell into disrepair and oblivion from the birth of the Classical
peoples—that is, from the Homeric period. It is a remarkably curious fact, proved beyond doubt
by the lack of epigraphic remains, that the Classical alphabet did not come into use till after 900,
and even then only to a limited extent and for the most pressing economic needs. Whereas in the
Egyptian, the Babylonian, the Mexican and the Chinese Cultures the formation of a script begins in
the very twilight of dawn, whereas the Germans made themselves a Runic alphabet and presently
developed that respect for writing as such which led to the successive refinements of ornamental
calligraphy, the Classical primitives were entirely ignorant of the numerous alphabets that were
current in the South and the East. We possess numerous inscriptions of Hittite Asia Minor and of
Crete, but not one of Homeric Greece. (See Vol. II, pp. 180 et seq.)</p>

into harmony with the epoch) as Hamlet, Don Quixote, Don Juan, and eventually Faust or Werther,

<p class='c001'><a href='#r10'>10</a>. Here the historian is gravely influenced by preconceptions derived from geography, which
assumes a <em>Continent</em> of Europe, and feels himself compelled to draw an ideal frontier corresponding to
the physical frontier between “Europe” and “Asia.” The word “Europe” ought to be struck out
of history. There is historically no “European” type, and it is sheer delusion to speak of the Hellenes
as “European Antiquity” (were Homer and Heraclitus and Pythagoras, then, Asiatics?) and to enlarge
upon their “mission” as such. These phrases express no realities but merely a sketchy interpretation
of the map. It is thanks to this word “Europe” alone, and the complex of ideas resulting from it,
that our historical consciousness has come to link Russia with the West in an utterly baseless unity—a
mere abstraction derived from the reading of books—that has led to immense real consequences.
In the shape of Peter the Great, this word has falsified the historical tendencies of a primitive human
mass for two centuries, whereas the Russian <em>instinct</em> has very truly and fundamentally divided “Europe”
from “Mother Russia” with the hostility that we can see embodied in Tolstoi, Aksakov or
Dostoyevski. “East” and “West” are notions that contain real history, whereas “Europe” is
an empty sound. Everything great that the Classical world created, it created in pure denial of the
existence of any continental barrier between Rome and Cyprus, Byzantium and Alexandria. Everything
that we imply by the term European Culture came into existence between the Vistula and the
Adriatic and the Guadalquivir and, even if we were to agree that Greece, the Greece of Pericles, lay
in Europe, the Greece of to-day certainly does not.</p>

systematic philosophy has overlooked him. Nevertheless he was a philosopher. His place <span lang="fr"><i>vis-à-vis</i></span>
Kant is the same as that of Plato—who similarly eludes the would-be-systematizer—<span lang="fr"><i>vis-à-vis</i></span>
Aristotle. Plato and Goethe stand for the philosophy of Becoming, Aristotle and Kant the philosophy
of Being. Here we have intuition opposed to analysis. Something that it is practically impossible
to convey by the methods of reason is found in individual sayings and poems of Goethe, e.g.,
in the Orphische Urworte, and stanzas like <span lang="de">“Wenn im Unendlichen”</span> and <span lang="de">“Sagt es Niemand,”</span> which
must be regarded as the expression of a <em>perfectly definite</em> metaphysical doctrine. I would not have one
single word changed in this: "The Godhead is effective in the living and not in the dead, in the
becoming and the changing, not in the become and the set-fast; and therefore, similarly, the reason
(<span lang="de"><i>Vernunft</i></span>) is concerned only to strive towards the divine through the becoming and the living, and
the understanding (<span lang="de"><i>Verstand</i></span>) only to make use of the become and the set-fast" (to Eckermann).

the picture of them with fitness-causes. But Goethe—who anticipated just about as much of
Darwinism as there will be left of it in fifty years from Darwin—<em>absolutely</em> excluded the causality-principle.
And the very fact that the Darwinians quite failed to notice its absence is a clear indication
that Goethe’s “Living Nature” belongs to actual life, "cause"-less and "aim"-less; for the
idea of the prime-phenomenon does not involve causal assumptions of any sort unless it has been

portraiture in sacred surroundings, evidenced for instance in the history of the <em>nimbus</em> or halo—which

race against time of the galley sent to Mitylene to countermand the order of massacre (Thucydides,
III, 49). But we observe that Thucydides gives twenty times the space to the debates at Athens that
he gives to the drama of the galley-rowers pulling night and day to save life. And we are told
that it was the Mitylenean ambassadors who spared no expense to make it worth the rowers’ while
to win, whereupon “there arose such a zeal of rowing that....” The final comment is, strictly
construing Thucydides’s own words: “Such was the magnitude of the danger that Mitylene passed

<p class='c001'><a href='#r177'>177</a>. Goethe’s theory of colour openly controverted Newton’s theory of light. A long account of
the controversy will be found in Chapter IX of G. H. Lewes’s <cite>Life of Goethe</cite>—a work that, taken
all in all, is one of the wisest biographies ever written. In reading his critique of Goethe’s theory,
of course, it has to be borne in mind that he wrote before the modern development of the electro-magnetic
theory, which has substituted a merely mathematical existence for the Newtonian physical
existence of colour-rays as such in white light. Now, this physical existence was just what, in
substance, Goethe denied. What he affirmed, in the simpler language of his day, was that white
light was something simple and colourless that becomes coloured through diminutions or modifications
imposed upon it by “darkness.” The modern physicist, using a subtler hypothesis than
Newton’s and a more refined “balance” than that which Lewes reproaches Goethe for “flinging
away,” has found in white light, not the Newtonian mixture of colour-rays, but a surge of irregular
wave-trains which are only regularized into colour-vibrations through being acted upon by analysers
of one sort and another, from prisms to particulate matter. This necessity of a counter-agent for the
production of colour seems—to a critical outsider at any rate—very like the necessity of an efficient
negative principle or “opaque” that Goethe’s intuitive interpretation of his experiments led him
to postulate. It is this that is the heart of the theory, and not the “simplicity” of light <span lang="la"><i>per se</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>So much it seems desirable to add to the text and the reference, in order to expand the author’s
statement that “both were right.” For Lewes, with all his sympathetic penetration of the man
and real appreciation of his scientific achievement, feels obliged to regard his methods and his theory
as such as “erroneous.” And it is perhaps not out of place in this book to adduce an instance of the
peculiar nature and power of intuitive vision (which entirely escapes direct description) in which
Vision frankly challenges Reason on its own ground, meets with refutation (or contempt) from the
Reason of its day, and yet may come to be upheld in its specific rightness (its rightness as vision, that

<p class='c001'><a href='#r180'>180</a>. The word <em>dimension</em> ought only to be used in the singular. It means extension but not extensions.
The idea of the three directions is an out-and-out abstraction and is not contained in the immediate
extension-feeling of the body (the “soul”). Direction as such, the direction-essence, gives
rise to the mysterious <em>animal</em> sense of right and left and also the <em>vegetable</em> characteristic of below-to-above,
earth to heaven. The latter is a fact felt dream-wise, the former a truth of waking existence
to be learned and therefore capable of being transmuted. Both find expression in architecture, to
wit, in the symmetry of the plan and the energy of the elevation, and it is only because of this that
we specially distinguish in the “architecture” of the space around us the angle of 90° in preference,
for example, to that of 60°. Had not this been so, the conventional number of our “dimensions”
would have been quite different.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r182'>182</a>. His idea that the <span lang="la"><i>a priori</i></span>-ness of space was proved by and through the unconditional validity
of simple geometrical facts rests, as we have already remarked, on the all-too-popular notion that
mathematics are either geometry or arithmetic. Now, even in Kant’s time the mathematic of the
West had got far beyond this naïve scheme, which was a mere imitation of the Classical. Modern
geometry bases itself not on space but on multiply-infinite number-manifolds—amongst which the
three-dimensional is simply the undistinguished special case—and within these groups investigates
functional formations with reference to their structure; that is, there is no longer any contact or even
possibility of contact between any possible kind of sense-perception and mathematical facts in the
domain of such extensions as these, and yet the demonstrability of the latter is in no wise impaired
thereby. Mathematics, then, are independent of the perceived, and the question now is, how much
of this famous demonstrability of the forms of perception is left when the artificiality of juxtaposing
both in a supposedly single process of experience has been recognized.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f183'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r183'>183</a>. It is true that a geometrical theorem may be proved, or rather demonstrated, by means of a

<p class='c001'><a href='#r187'>187</a>. Either in Greek or in Latin, τόπος (= <span lang="la"><i>locus</i></span>) means spot, locality, and also social position;
χώρα (= <span lang="la"><i>spatium</i></span>) means space-between, distance, rank, and also ground and soil (e.g., τὰ ἐκ τῆς χώρας,
produce); τὸ κένον (<cite>vacuum</cite>) means quite unequivocally a hollow body, and the stress is emphatically
on the envelope. The literature of the Roman Imperial Age, which attempted to render the <cite>Magian</cite>
world-feeling through Classical words, was reduced to such clumsy versions as ὁρατὸς τόπος (sensible
world) or <span lang="la"><i>spatium inane</i></span> (“endless space,” but also “wide surface”—the root of the word
“spatium” means to swell or grow fat). In the true Classical literature, the idea not being there,
there was no necessity for a word to describe it.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f188'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r188'>188</a>. It has not hitherto been seen that this fact is implicit in Euclid’s famous parallel axiom
(“through a point only one parallel to a straight line is possible”).</p>

<p class='c001'>This was the only one of the Classical theorems which remained unproved, and as we know now,
it is incapable of proof. But it was just that which made it into a dogma (as opposed to any experience)
<em>and therefore the metaphysical centre</em> and main girder of that geometrical system. Everything
else, axiom or postulate, is merely introductory or corollary to this. This one proposition is necessary
and universally-valid for the Classical intellect, <em>and yet not deducible</em>. What does this signify?</p>

<p class='c001'>It signifies that the statement is a <em>symbol</em> of the first rank. It contains the structure of Classical
corporeality. It is just this proposition, theoretically the weakest link in the Classical geometry
(objections began to be raised to it as early as Hellenistic times), that reveals its soul, and it was just
this proposition, self-evident within the limits of routine experience, that the Faustian number-thinking,
derived from incorporeal spatial distances, fastened upon as the centre of doubt. It is one
of the deepest symbols of <em>our</em> being that we have opposed to the Euclidean geometry not one but
<em>several</em> other geometries all of which for us are equally true and self-consistent. The specific tendency
of the anti-Euclidean group of geometries—in which there may be no parallel or two parallels or
several parallels to a line through a point—lies in the fact that by their very plurality the corporeal
sense of extension, which Euclid <em>canonized</em> by his principle, is entirely got rid of; for what they
reject is that which all corporeal postulates but all spatial denies. The question of which of the
three Non-Euclidean geometries is the “correct” one (i.e., that which underlies actuality)—although
Gauss himself gave it earnest consideration—is in respect of world-feeling entirely Classical
and therefore it should not have been asked by a thinker of our sphere. Indeed it prevents us from
seeing the true and deep meaning implicit in the plurality of these geometries. The specifically
Western symbol resides not in the reality of one or of another, but in the true plurality of <em>equally
possible</em> geometries. It is the <em>group</em> of space-structures—in the abundance of which the classical
system is a mere particular case—that has dissolved the last residuum of the corporeal into the pure
space-feeling.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f189'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r189'>189</a>. This zero, which probably contains a suggestion of the <em>Indian</em> idea of extension—of that
spatiality of the world that is treated in the Upanishads and is entirely alien to our space-consciousness—was
of course wholly absent in the Classical. By way of the Arabian mathematics (which
completely transformed its meaning) it reached the West, where it was only introduced in 1554 by
Stipel, with its sense, moreover, again fundamentally changed, for it became the mean of +1 and
-1 as a cut in a linear continuum, i.e., it was assimilated to the Western number-world in a wholly
un-Indian sense of <em>relation</em>.</p>

do with the building-up of the city but were connected with sacral rules, as the significance of this
precinct (the “Pomœrium”) in later times shows. A “templum,” too, was the Roman camp whose
rectangular outline is visible to-day in many a Roman-founded town; it was the consecrated area
within which the army felt itself under the protection of its gods, and originally had nothing whatever
to do with fortification, which is a product of Hellenistic times. (It may be added that Roman
camps retained their rigidity of outline even where obvious “military considerations” of ground,
etc., must have suggested its modification.—<i>Tr.</i>) Most Roman stone-temples ("<span lang="la"><i>ædes</i></span>") were not
“templa” at all. On the other hand, the early Greek τέμενος of Homeric times must have had a

But that which we now call “Chinese art” corresponds, say, to the art of Egypt from the Twentieth
Dynasty onward, and the great schools of painting find their parallel in the sculpture schools of the
Saïte and Ptolemaic periods, in which an antiquarian preciosity takes the place of the living inward
development that is no longer there. Thus from the examples of Egypt we are able to tell how far
it is permissible to argue backwards to conclusions about the art of Chóu and Vedic times.</p>

built basilicas; its Roman catacombs show that artistically it was entirely on a par with Western

<p class='c001'><a href='#r272'>272</a>. <span lang="de"><i>Die bildenden Künste.</i></span> The expression is a standard one in German, but unfamiliar in English.
Ordinarily, however, <span lang="de">“die bildenden Künste”</span> (shaping arts, arts of form) are contrasted with <span lang="de">“die

<div class='footnote' id='f273'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r273'>273</a>. As soon as the word, which is a transmission-agent of the understanding, comes to be used as
the expression-agent of an art, the waking consciousness ceases to express or to take in a thing
integrally. Not to mention the <em>read</em> word of higher Cultures—the medium of literature proper—even
the spoken word, when used in any artificial sense, separates hearing from understanding, for
the ordinary meaning of the word also takes a hand in the process and, as this art grows in power,
the wordless arts themselves arrive at expression-methods in which the motives are joined to word-meanings.
Thus arises the <em>Allegory</em>, or motive that <em>signifies a word</em>, as in Baroque sculpture after
Bernini. So, too, painting very often develops into a sort of painting-writing, as in Byzantium after
the second Nicene Council (787) which took from the artist his freedom of choice and arrangement.
This also is what distinguishes the arias of Gluck, in which the melody grew up out of the meaning
of the libretto, from those of Alessandro Scarlatti, in which the texts are in themselves of no significance
and mostly serve to carry the voices. The high-Gothic counterpoint of the 13th Century
is entirely free from any connexion with words: it is a <em>pure architecture of human voices</em> in which
several texts, Latin and vernacular, sacred and secular, were sung together.</p>

The result is a theory of “Art” that is a pious fraud.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r284'>284</a>. All Greek scales are capable of reduction to “tetrachords” or four-note scales of which the
form E—note—note—A is typical. In the diatonic the unspecified inner notes are F, G; in the
chromatic they are F, F sharp; and in the enharmonic they are E half-sharp, F. Thus, the chromatic
and enharmonic scales do not provide additional notes as the modern chromatic does, but simply
displace the inner members of the scale downwards, altering the proportionate distances between
the same given total. In Faustian music, on the contrary, the meaning of “enharmonic” is simply
<em>relational</em>. It is applied to a change, say from A flat to G sharp. The difference between these two
is not a quarter-tone but a “very small” interval (theory and practice do not even agree as to which
note is the higher, and in tempered instruments with standardized scales the physical difference
is eliminated altogether). While a note is being sounded, even without any physical change in it,
its harmonic co-ordinates (i.e., substantially, the key of the harmony) may alter, so that henceforth
the note, from A flat, has become G sharp.—<i>Tr.</i></p>

up illumined distances. Yellow and red, on the other hand, the colours of nearness, the <em>popular</em>

vulgarity. The tone of an old fiddle is entirely bodiless. It is worth remarking that the Greek music,
insignificent as it is, underwent an evolution from the Dorian lyre to the Ionian flute (aulos and

it as a profanation; the worship that shines through the Homeric poems is quite without idolatry,
and a further proof is the anger of thinkers who, like Heraclitus and Plato, were in close touch with
the temple tradition. It will occur to the student that the unrestricted handling of even the highest
divinities in this very late art is not unlike the theatrical Catholicism of Rossini and Liszt, which
is already foreshadowed in Corelli and Händel and had, earlier even, almost led to the condemnation
of Church music in 1564.</p>

<p class='c001'>(The event alluded to in the last line is the dispute in and after the Council of Trent as to the

that the Council found it necessary to forbid “unworthy music in the house of God” and to bring the
subject under the disciplinary control of the Bishops.—<i>Tr.</i>)</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r356'>356</a>. It is the same “noble simplicity and quiet greatness”—to speak in the language of the
German Classicists—that produces such an impression of the antique in the Romanesque of Hildesheim,
Gernrode, Paulinzella and Hersfeld. The ruined cloisters of Paulinzella, in fact, have much
of what Brunellesco so many centuries later strove to obtain in his palace-courts. But the basic feeling
that underlies these creations is not something which we got from the Classical, but something
that we projected on to our own notion of Classical being. And our own notion of peace is one of an
<em>infinite</em> peace. We feel the “Rest in God” to be an <em>expanse</em> of quietude. All Florentine work, in so
far as sureness does not turn into the Gothic challenge of Verrocchio, is characterized by this feeling,
with which Attic σωφροσύνη has nothing whatever in common.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r357'>357</a>. It has never been sufficiently noticed that the few sculptors who came after Michelangelo
had no more than a mere workaday relation with marble. But we see at once that it is so when we
think of the deeply intimate relation of great musicians to their favourite instruments. The story
of Tartini’s violin, which shattered itself to pieces on the death of the master—and there are a
hundred such stories—is the Faustian counterpart of the Pygmalion legend. Consider, too, E. T.
A. Hoffmann’s “Johannes Kreisler the Kapellmeister”; he is a figure worthy to stand by the side
of Faust, Werther and Don Juan. To see his symbolic significance and the inward necessity of him,
we have only to compare him with the theatrical painter-characters in the works of contemporary
Romanticists, who are not in any relation whatever with the idea of Painting. As the fate of 19th-Century
art-romances shows—a painter <em>cannot</em> be made to stand for the destiny of Faustian art.</p>

<p class='c001'>(E. T. A. Hoffmann, the strange many-sided genius who was at once musician, caricaturist,
novelist, critic, wit, able public official and winebibber, at one time in his career wrote in the character

fire-arms was only accomplished during the 16th Century. It cannot be said that there
was any <em>technical</em> reason why 100 years should have elapsed between the first use of powder in
European warfare and the first effective soldier’s fire-arm. No careful student of this period of
military history can fail to be struck with this fact—the significance of which, not being technical,
must be cultural. Much the same could be said of printing, which, so far as concerns technical factors,
might just as well have been invented in the 10th as in the 15th Century.—<i>Tr.</i></p>

Ent and Nonent, focussed themselves, in Zeno, down to the famous paradoxes concerning the nature
of motion (such as “Achilles and the Tortoise”) which within the Greek discipline were unanswerable.
Their general effect was to show that motion depended upon the existence of an indefinitely
great plurality, that is, of infinitely small subdivisions as well as infinitely great quantities, and, the
denial of this plurality being the essential feature of the Eleatic philosophy, its application to motion
was bound to produce “paradoxes.”</p>

function of perspective is to subject things to the “I,” which in ordering comprehends them; and it
is a further indication that “will”—the claim to command the world—is absent from the Classical
make-up that its painting denies the perspective background. In Chinese perspective as in Chinese
technique (see Vol. II, p. 627), <em>directional</em> energy is wanting, and it would not be illegitimate to call

<p class='c001'><a href='#r391'>391</a>. The great part played by learned Jesuits in the development of theoretical physics must not be
overlooked. Father Boscovich, with his system of atomic forces (1759), made the first serious advance
beyond Newton. The idea of the equivalence of God and pure space is even more evident in
Jesuit work than it is in that of the Jansenists of Port Royal with whom Descartes and Pascal were
associated.</p>

<p class='c001'>(Boscovich’s atomic theory is discussed by James Clerk Maxwell in Ency. Brit., XI ed., XVIII,

<p class='c001'><a href='#r392'>392</a>. Luther placed practical activity (the day’s demands, as Goethe said) at the very centre of
morale, and that is one of the main reasons why it was to the deeper natures that Protestantism
appealed most cogently. Works of piety devoid of directional energy (in the sense that we give the
words here) fell at once from the high esteem in which they had been sustained (as the Renaissance
was sustained) by a relic of <em>Southern</em> feeling. On ethical grounds monasticism thenceforth falls
into ever-increasing disrepute. In the Gothic Age entry into the cloister, the renunciation of care,
deed and will, had been an act of the loftiest ethical character—the highest sacrifice that it was possible
to imagine, that of <em>life</em>. But in the Baroque even Roman Catholics no longer felt thus about
it. And the institutions, no longer of renunciation but merely of inactive comfort, went down before
the spirit of the Enlightenment.</p>

Franciscan “Zealots” and the disciples of Joachim of Floris, that its meaning underwent the decisive
reversal. Expressing thenceforward a condition of profound excitement which strained to discharge
itself, it became finally a generic name for all spiritual dynamic; in this sense of strong will

<p class='c001'><a href='#r406'>406</a>. As the student of cultural history to-day is not necessarily familiar with technical Greek, it
may be helpful to reproduce from Cornish’s edition of Smith’s “Greek and Roman Antiquities,”
s.v. “Tragoedia,” the following paragraph, as clear as it is succinct:</p>

<p class='c001'>“Tragedy is described by Aristotle (<cite>Poet.</cite>, VI, 2) as effecting by means of pity and terror that
purgation [of the soul] (κάθαρσις) which belongs to [is proper for] such feelings.”... Tragedy
excites pity and terror by presenting to the mind things which are truly pitiable and terrible. When
pity and terror are moved, as tragedy moves them, by a worthy cause, then the mind experiences
that sense of relief which comes from finding an outlet for a natural energy. And thus the impressions
made by Tragedy leave behind them in the spectator a temperate and harmonious state of the soul.
Similarly Aristotle speaks of the enthusiastic worshippers of Dionysus as obtaining a κάθαρσις,
a healthful relief, by the “lyric utterance of their sacred frenzy.”—<i>Tr.</i></p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f407'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r407'>407</a>. The evolution of ideals of stage-presentation in the minds of Æschylus, Sophocles and Euripides

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f408'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r408'>408</a>. It must be repeated that the Hellenistic shadow-painting of Zeuxis and Apollodorus is a modelling
of the individual body for the purpose of producing the plastic effect on the eye. There was no
idea of rendering space by means of light and shade. The body is “shaded” but it <em>casts no shadow</em>.</p>

<p class='c001'>(Contrast with this Dante’s exact and careful specification of the time-of-day in every episode

this significant passion for gigantic sums, for indefinitely big and indefinitely minute measurements,
for “records” and statistics, is playing a conspicuous part.</p>

<p class='c001'>(Our very notation of number is ceasing to rest on sense-standards. Science has carried number,
as ordinarily written, so high and so low that it now uses a <em>movable base</em> for its numerical statements.
For example, a number in astronomy is written, not as 3,450,000,000 but as 3.45 × 10<sup>9</sup>, one
relating to ordinary experience as 3.45 (i.e., 3.45 × 10<sup>0</sup>) and one in electromagnetic theory, not
as 0.00000345 but as 3.45 × 10<sup>-6</sup>. Under this system the conceptual unit may be as large or as small,
compared with the unit of daily experience, as the region of thought in which the calculation is
taking place requires. And different conceptual worlds can be connected as to number [say, a number
of kilometres brought into an order of thought that deals with millimetres] by simply changing the
ten-power.—<i>Tr.</i>)</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f415'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r415'>415</a>. In stellar calculations even the mean radius of the earth’s orbit (1.493 × 10<sup>13</sup> cm.) hardly
suffices as unit, as the distance of a star of one second parallax is already 206,265 such units away from
us; star-distances are reckoned therefore either in light-years or in terms of the unit distance of a
star of this standard parallax.—<i>Tr.</i></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f416'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r416'>416</a>. As early as the second millennium before Christ they worked from Iceland and the North Sea
past Finisterre to the Canaries and West Africa. An echo of these voyagings lingers in the Atlantis-saga
of the Greeks. The realm of Tartessus (at the mouth of the Guadalquivir) appears to have
been a centre of these movements (see Leo Frobenius, <span lang="de"><i>Das unbekannte Afrika</i></span>, p. 139). Some sort of
relation, too, there must have been between them and the movements of the “sea peoples,” Viking
swarms which after long land-wanderings from North to South built themselves ships again on the
Black Sea or the Ægean and burst out against Egypt from the time of Rameses II (1292-1225). The
Egyptian reliefs show their ship-types to have been quite different from the native and the Phœnician;
but they may well have been similar to those that Cæsar found afterwards among the Veneti
of Brittany. A later example of such outbursts is afforded by the Varyags or Varangians in Russia
and at Constantinople. No doubt more light will shortly be thrown on the courses of
these movement-streams.</p>

the Western Church never conceived its mission thus. The “Glad Tidings” of Jesus, like those of
Zoroaster, of Mani, of Mahomet, of the Neo-Platonists and of all the cognate Magian religions were
mystic benefits <em>displayed</em> but in nowise imposed. Youthful Christianity, when it had flowed into the
Western world, merely imitated the missionarism of the later Stoa, itself by that time thoroughly
Magian. Paul may be thought of as urgent; the itinerant preachers of the Stoa were certainly so, as
we know from our authorities. But <em>commanding</em> they were not. To illustrate by a somewhat farfetched
parallel—in direct contrast to the physicians of the Magian stamp who merely proclaimed
the virtues of their mysterious arcana, the medical men of the West seek to obtain for their knowledge
the <em>force of civil law</em>, as for instance in the matter of vaccination or the inspection of pork for
trichina.</p>

<p class='c001'>(It seems desirable to supplement this a little for the non-technical reader, by stating, however
roughly and generally, the principle and process of transmutation as the alchemist saw them. All
metals consist of mercury and sulphur. Remove “materiality” from common mercury (or from the
mercury-content of the metal under treatment) by depriving it (or the metal) of “earthness,”
“liquidness” and “airiness” (i.e., volatility) and we have a prime, substantial (though not material)
and stable thing. Similarly, remove materiality from sulphur (or the sulphur-content of the
metal treated) and it becomes an elixir, efficient for generating attributes. Then, the prime matter
and the elixir react upon one another so that the product on reassuming materiality is a different
metal, or rather a “metallicity” endowed with different characters and attributes. The production
of one metal from another thus depends merely on the modalities of working processes.—<i>Tr.</i>)</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r499'>499</a>. Few passages in the Acts of the Apostles have obtained a stronger hold on <em>our</em> imagination
than Paul’s meeting with the altar of “the Unknown God” at Phalerum (Acts XVII, 23). And yet
we have perfectly definite evidence, later than Paul’s time, of the plurality of the gods to whom this
altar was dedicated. Pausanias in his guide-book (I, 24) says: “here there are ... altars of the
gods styled Unknowns, of heroes, etc.” (βωμοί δε θεῶν τε ὀνομαζομένων Ἀγνώστων καὶ
ἡρῴων ... κ.τ.λ.). Such, however, is the force of our fixed idea that even Sir J. G. Frazer, in his
“Pausanias and Other Studies,” speaks of “The Altar to the Unknown God which St. Paul, and
Pausanias after him, saw.” More, he follows this up with a description of a dialogue “attributed
to Lucian” (2nd Cent. <span class='fss'>A.D.</span>) in which the Unknown God of Athens figures in a Christian discussion;
but this dialogue (the Philopatris) is almost universally regarded as a much later work, dating at
earliest from Julian’s time (mid-4th Cent.) and probably from that of Nicephorus Phocas (10th
Cent.).—<i>Tr.</i></p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r510'>510</a>. The symbolic importance of the Title, and its relation to the concept and idea of the Person,
cannot here be dealt with. It must suffice to draw attention to the fact that the Classical is the only
Culture in which the Title is unknown. It would have been in contradiction with the strictly somatic
character of their names. Apart from personal and family names, only the technical names of offices
actually exercised were in use. “Augustus” became at once a personal name, “Cæsar” very soon a
designation of office. The advance of the Magian feeling can be seen in the way in which courtesy-expressions
of the Late-Roman bureaucracy, like <span lang="la">“Vir clarissimus,”</span> became permanent titles of
honour which could be conferred and cancelled. In just the same way, the names of old and foreign
deities became titles of the recognized Godhead; e.g., Saviour and Healer (Asklepios) and Good
Shepherd (Orpheus) are titles of Christ. In the Classical, on the contrary, we find the secondary
names of Roman deities evolving into independent and separate gods.</p>

that industry “finds outlets for itself” and that Rationalism “has come into power.” No Classical

Stoics. There is an essential difference, too, between the imagery of Classical and that of Western

<p class='c001'>The use of an extra ‘S’ in the name of ‘Hagia S Sophia’ on p. <a href='#Page_200'>200</a> is questionable. If it is
an abbreviation of ‘Saint’ as it is a line early, it is redundant here given the
word ‘Hagia’, meaning the same thing.</p>

<p class='c001'>On p. <a href='#Page_407'>407</a>, footnotes <a href='#f508'>508</a> and <a href='#f509'>509</a> refer to the same work, <span lang="de"><cite>Religion und Kultus der Römer</cite></span>.
However the citation of the first note is garbled, as <span lang="de"><cite>Kult. und. Relig. d. Römer</cite></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the Index, a reference to the effect on natural science of the
Relativity Theory was corrupted as ‘19;4’. The proper page is p. <a href='#Page_419'>419</a>,
and the reference is corrected.</p>

<p class='c001'>The page reference to a note on Goethe and Materialism should have been to
p. <a href='#Page_111'>111</a>, not p. 211.</p>

<p class='c001'>The page references in footnote <a href='#f486'>486</a> most likely refer
to Volume II, since the two pages mentioned contain no pertinent
material.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are a number of index entries which refer to footnotes on a
given page while the topics appear in the main text. This would seem
to indicate that the preparation of the Index was not reviewed after
the final version of the text was complete. These references have
been amended to direct the reader to the correct page:</p>

<p class='c009'>Intercultural Contemporaneity (multiple times)
(p. <a href='#Page_112'>112</a>), Frescos (p. <a href='#Page_225'>225</a>), Tasso (p. <a href='#Page_325'>325</a>),</p>

<p class='c001'>The reference to Saint John and world-history as a note on p. <a href='#Page_18'>18</a>
seems incorrect. Footnote <a href='#f13'>13</a> on that page refers to
the Apostle Paul. The reference is left unlinked.</p>

<p class='c001'>On p. <a href='#Page_a.vi'>vi</a> of the Index, a cross-referenced ‘Motherland’ topic
is missing.</p>

<p class='c001'>Minor punctuation lapses in the Index have been corrected without
further notice.</p>

<p class='c001'>Other errors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected, and
are noted here. The references are to the page and line in the original.</p>
